                          (i)    Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if it is determined, through an appropriate evaluation under §§
                                 300.304 through 300.311, that a child has one of the disabilities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but
                                 only needs a related service and not special education, the child is not a child with a disability under this part.

                          (ii)   If, consistent with § 300.39(a)(2), the related service required by the child is considered special education rather
                                 than a related service under State standards, the child would be determined to be a child with a disability under
                                 paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
             (b) Children aged three through nine experiencing developmental delays. Child with a disability for children aged three through
                   nine (or any subset of that age range, including ages three through five), may, subject to the conditions described in §
                   300.111(b), include a child—

                   (1) Who is experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic
                         instruments and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: Physical development, cognitive development,
                         communication development, social or emotional development, or adaptive development; and

                   (2) Who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.

             (c)   Definitions of disability terms. The terms used in this definition of a child with a disability are defined as follows:

                   (1)

                          (i)    Autism means a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social
                                 interaction, generally evident before age three, that adversely affects a child's educational performance. Other
                                 characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements,
                                 resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.

                          (ii)   Autism does not apply if a child's educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has
                                 an emotional disturbance, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

                         (iii) A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age three could be identified as having autism if the
                                 criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied.

                   (2) Deaf-blindness means concomitant hearing and visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe
                         communication and other developmental and educational needs that they cannot be accommodated in special
                         education programs solely for children with deafness or children with blindness.

                   (3) Deafness means a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information
                         through hearing, with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child's educational performance.

                   (4)

                          (i)    Emotional disturbance means a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long
                                 period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child's educational performance:

                                 (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.

                                 (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.

                                 (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances.

                                 (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.

                                 (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

                          (ii)   Emotional disturbance includes schizophrenia. The term does not apply to children who are socially maladjusted,
                                 unless it is determined that they have an emotional disturbance under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

                   (5) Hearing impairment means an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's
                         educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness in this section.

                   (6) Intellectual disability means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with deficits
                         in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period, that adversely affects a child's educational
                         performance. The term “intellectual disability” was formerly termed “mental retardation.”

                   (7) Multiple disabilities means concomitant impairments (such as intellectual disability-blindness or intellectual disability-
                         orthopedic impairment), the combination of which causes such severe educational needs that they cannot be
                         accommodated in special education programs solely for one of the impairments. Multiple disabilities does not include

                         deaf-blindness.
                   (8) Orthopedic impairment means a severe orthopedic impairment that adversely affects a child's educational
                         performance. The term includes impairments caused by a congenital anomaly, impairments caused by disease (e.g.,
                         poliomyelitis, bone tuberculosis), and impairments from other causes (e.g., cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures
                         or burns that cause contractures).

                   (9) Other health impairment means having limited strength, vitality, or alertness, including a heightened alertness to
                         environmental stimuli, that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment, that—

                          (i)    Is due to chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, attention deficit disorder or attention deficit
                                 hyperactivity disorder, diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, lead poisoning, leukemia, nephritis,
                                 rheumatic fever, sickle cell anemia, and Tourette syndrome; and

                          (ii)   Adversely affects a child's educational performance.

                   (10) Specific learning disability —

                          (i)    General. Specific learning disability means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes
                                 involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in the imperfect ability
                                 to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as
                                 perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.

                          (ii)   Disorders not included. Specific learning disability does not include learning problems that are primarily the result
                                 of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, of intellectual disability, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental,
                                 cultural, or economic disadvantage.

                   (11) Speech or language impairment means a communication disorder, such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language
                         impairment, or a voice impairment, that adversely affects a child's educational performance.

                   (12) Traumatic brain injury means an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force, resulting in total or
                         partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or both, that adversely affects a child's educational
                         performance. Traumatic brain injury applies to open or closed head injuries resulting in impairments in one or more
                         areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; reasoning; abstract thinking; judgment; problem-solving;
                         sensory, perceptual, and motor abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical functions; information processing; and
                         speech. Traumatic brain injury does not apply to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative, or to brain injuries
                         induced by birth trauma.

       § 300.9 Consent.
            Consent means that—

                   (a) The parent has been fully informed of all information relevant to the activity for which consent is sought, in his or her
                         native language, or through another mode of communication;

                   (b) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the carrying out of the activity for which his or her consent is sought,
                         and the consent describes that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be released and to whom; and

                   (c)

                          (1) The parent understands that the granting of consent is voluntary on the part of the parent and may be revoked at
                                 any time.

                          (2) If a parent revokes consent, that revocation is not retroactive (i.e., it does not negate an action that has occurred
                                 after the consent was given and before the consent was revoked).

                          (3) If the parent revokes consent in writing for their child's receipt of special education services after the child is

             (b) FAPE for children beginning at age 3.

                   (1) Each State must ensure that—

                          (i)    The obligation to make FAPE available to each eligible child residing in the State begins no later than the child's
                                 third birthday; and

                          (ii)   An IEP or an IFSP is in effect for the child by that date, in accordance with § 300.323(b).

       § 300.102 Limitation—exception to FAPE for certain ages.
             (a) General. The obligation to make FAPE available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to the following:

                   (1) Children aged 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20, or 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be
                         inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to
                         children of those ages.

                   (2)

                          (i)    Children aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related

                                 (A) Had been identified as a child with a disability under § 300.8 and had received services in accordance with
                                      an IEP, but who left school prior to their incarceration; or

                                 (B) Did not have an IEP in their last educational setting, but who had actually been identified as a child with a
                                      disability under § 300.8.

                   (3)

                         (iv) As used in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, the term regular high school diploma means the
                                standard high school diploma awarded to the preponderance of students in the State that is fully aligned with
                                State standards, or a higher diploma, except that a regular high school diploma shall not be aligned to the
                                alternate academic achievement standards described in section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the ESEA. A regular high school
                                diploma does not include a recognized equivalent of a diploma, such as a general equivalency diploma,
                                certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or similar lesser credential.

       § 300.103 FAPE—methods and payments.
             (a) Each State may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private sources of support that are available in the State to meet the
                   requirements of this part. For example, if it is necessary to place a child with a disability in a residential facility, a State
                   could use joint agreements between the agencies involved for sharing the cost of that placement.

             (b) Nothing in this part relieves an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or to pay for
                   services provided to a child with a disability.

             (c)   Consistent with § 300.323(c), the State must ensure that there is no delay in implementing a child's IEP, including any case
                   in which the payment source for providing or paying for special education and related services to the child is being
                   determined.

       If placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide special education and related services to a child with a

                   (2) Extended school year services must be provided only if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual basis, in
                         accordance with §§ 300.320 through 300.324, that the services are necessary for the provision of FAPE to the child.

                   and necessary by the child's IEP Team, to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in the manner
                   necessary to afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in those services and activities.

                   (1) A State that adopts a definition of developmental delay under § 300.8(b) determines whether the term applies to
                         children aged three through nine, or to a subset of that age range (e.g., ages three through five).

                   (2) A State may not require an LEA to adopt and use the term developmental delay for any children within its jurisdiction.

                   (3) If an LEA uses the term developmental delay for children described in § 300.8(b), the LEA must conform to both the
                         State's definition of that term and to the age range that has been adopted by the State.

                   (4) If a State does not adopt the term developmental delay, an LEA may not independently use that term as a basis for
                         establishing a child's eligibility under this part.

                                 section 619(g) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged three
                                 through five who are enrolled by their parents in a private, including religious, elementary school located in the
                                 school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged three
                                 through five.

                          (ii)   As described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, children aged three through five are considered to be
                                 parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, including religious,
                                 elementary schools, if they are enrolled in a private school that meets the definition of elementary school in §
                                 300.13.

                   (3) If an LEA has not expended for equitable services all of the funds described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this
                         section by the end of the fiscal year for which Congress appropriated the funds, the LEA must obligate the remaining
                         funds for special education and related services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school children
                         with disabilities during a carry-over period of one additional year.

             (b) Calculating proportionate amount. In calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds to be provided for parentally-
                   placed private school children with disabilities, the LEA, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of
                   private schools under § 300.134, must conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of
                   parentally-placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA. (See appendix B for an example of
                   how proportionate share is calculated).

             (c)   Annual count of the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.

                   (1) Each LEA must—

                          (i)    After timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of parentally-placed private school children with
                                 disabilities (consistent with § 300.134), determine the number of parentally-placed private school children with
                                 disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA; and

                          (ii)   Ensure that the count is conducted on any date between October 1 and December 1, inclusive, of each year.

                   (2) The count must be used to determine the amount that the LEA must spend on providing special education and related
                         services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities in the next subsequent fiscal year.

             (d) Supplement, not supplant. State and local funds may supplement and in no case supplant the proportionate amount of
                   Federal funds required to be expended for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under this part.

             (b) Proportionate share of funds. The determination of the proportionate share of Federal funds available to serve parentally-
                   placed private school children with disabilities under § 300.133(b), including the determination of how the proportionate
                   share of those funds was calculated.

                   participate in special education and related services.

             (d) Provision of special education and related services. How, where, and by whom special education and related services will be

                   private school officials a written explanation of the reasons why the LEA chose not to provide services directly or through a
                   contract.

       § 300.136 Compliance.
             (a) General. A private school official has the right to submit a complaint to the SEA that the LEA—

                   (1) Did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely; or

                   (2) Did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official.

             (b) Procedure.

                   (1) If the private school official wishes to submit a complaint, the official must provide to the SEA the basis of the

       § 300.137 Equitable services determined.
             (a) No individual right to special education and related services. No parentally-placed private school child with a disability has an
                   individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in
                   a public school.

             (b) Decisions.

                   (1) Decisions about the services that will be provided to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities under
                         §§ 300.130 through 300.144 must be made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 300.134(d).

                   (2) The LEA must make the final decisions with respect to the services to be provided to eligible parentally-placed private
                         school children with disabilities.

             (c)   Services plan for each child served under §§ 300.130 through 300.144. If a child with a disability is enrolled in a religious or
                   other private school by the child's parents and will receive special education or related services from an LEA, the LEA must
                   —

                   (1) Initiate and conduct meetings to develop, review, and revise a services plan for the child, in accordance with §
                         300.138(b); and

                   (2) Ensure that a representative of the religious or other private school attends each meeting. If the representative cannot
                         attend, the LEA shall use other methods to ensure participation by the religious or other private school, including
                         individual or conference telephone calls.

                         school and secondary school teachers who are providing equitable services to parentally-placed private school
                         children with disabilities do not have to meet the special education teacher qualification requirements in § 300.156(c).

                   (2) Parentally-placed private school children with disabilities may receive a different amount of services than children with

                   (1) Each parentally-placed private school child with a disability who has been designated to receive services under §
                         300.132 must have a services plan that describes the specific special education and related services that the LEA will
                         provide to the child in light of the services that the LEA has determined, through the process described in §§ 300.134
                         and 300.137, it will make available to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities.

                   (2) The services plan must, to the extent appropriate—

                          (i)    Meet the requirements of § 300.320, or for a child ages three through five, meet the requirements of § 300.323(b)
                                 with respect to the services provided; and

                          (ii)   Be developed, reviewed, and revised consistent with §§ 300.321 through 300.324.

                         Children With Disabilities Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools When FAPE Is at Issue

       § 300.148 Placement of children by parents when FAPE is at issue.
             (a) General. This part does not require an LEA to pay for the cost of education, including special education and related services,
                   of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made FAPE available to the child and the parents
                   elected to place the child in a private school or facility. However, the public agency must include that child in the population
                   whose needs are addressed consistent with §§ 300.131 through 300.144.

             (b) Disagreements about FAPE. Disagreements between the parents and a public agency regarding the availability of a program
                   appropriate for the child, and the question of financial reimbursement, are subject to the due process procedures in §§
                   300.504 through 300.520.

             (c)   Reimbursement for private school placement. If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special
                   education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private preschool, elementary
                   school, or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require
                   the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had
                   not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment and that the private placement is
                   appropriate. A parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a hearing officer or a court even if it does not meet
                   the State standards that apply to education provided by the SEA and LEAs.

             (d) Limitation on reimbursement. The cost of reimbursement described in paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced or
                   denied—

                   (1) If—

                          (i)    At the most recent IEP Team meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public
                                 school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the public
                                 agency to provide FAPE to their child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a
                                 private school at public expense; or

                          (ii)   At least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the
                                 child from the public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information
                                 described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section;

                   (2) If, prior to the parents' removal of the child from the public school, the public agency informed the parents, through the
                         notice requirements described in § 300.503(a)(1), of its intent to evaluate the child (including a statement of the
                         purpose of the evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child available for
                         the evaluation; or

                   (3) Upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents.

             (e)   Exception. Notwithstanding the notice requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the cost of reimbursement—

                   (1) Must not be reduced or denied for failure to provide the notice if—

                          (i)    The school prevented the parents from providing the notice;

                          (ii)   The parents had not received notice, pursuant to § 300.504, of the notice requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this
                                 section; or

                         (iii) Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely result in physical harm to the child; and

                   (2) May, in the discretion of the court or a hearing officer, not be reduced or denied for failure to provide this notice if—

                          (i)    The parents are not literate or cannot write in English; or

                          (ii)   Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child.

                   (2) That each educational program for children with disabilities administered within the State, including each program
                         administered by any other State or local agency (but not including elementary schools and secondary schools for
                         Indian children operated or funded by the Secretary of the Interior)—

                          (i)    Is under the general supervision of the persons responsible for educational programs for children with disabilities

       § 300.151 Adoption of State complaint procedures.
             (a) General. Each SEA must adopt written procedures for—

                   (1) Resolving any complaint, including a complaint filed by an organization or individual from another State, that meets the
                         requirements of § 300.153 by—

                          (i)    Providing for the filing of a complaint with the SEA; and

                          (ii)   At the SEA's discretion, providing for the filing of a complaint with a public agency and the right to have the SEA
                                 review the public agency's decision on the complaint; and

             (b) Remedies for denial of appropriate services. In resolving a complaint in which the SEA has found a failure to provide
                   appropriate services, an SEA, pursuant to its general supervisory authority under Part B of the Act, must address—

                   (1) The failure to provide appropriate services, including corrective action appropriate to address the needs of the child

                                 consistent with § 300.506;

                   (4) Review all relevant information and make an independent determination as to whether the public agency is violating a
                         requirement of Part B of the Act or of this part; and

                   (5) Issue a written decision to the complainant that addresses each allegation in the complaint and contains—

                                 to the individual or organization under State procedures) and the public agency involved agree to extend the time
                                 to engage in mediation pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or to engage in other alternative means of

                   (1) If a written complaint is received that is also the subject of a due process hearing under § 300.507 or §§ 300.530
                         through 300.532, or contains multiple issues of which one or more are part of that hearing, the State must set aside
                         any part of the complaint that is being addressed in the due process hearing until the conclusion of the hearing.
                         However, any issue in the complaint that is not a part of the due process action must be resolved using the time limit
                         and procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

                   (2) If an issue raised in a complaint filed under this section has previously been decided in a due process hearing involving

                          (i)    The due process hearing decision is binding on that issue; and

                          (ii)   The SEA must inform the complainant to that effect.

                   (3) A complaint alleging a public agency's failure to implement a due process hearing decision must be resolved by the

       § 300.154 Methods of ensuring services.
             (a) Establishing responsibility for services. The Chief Executive Officer of a State or designee of that officer must ensure that an
                   interagency agreement or other mechanism for interagency coordination is in effect between each noneducational public
                   agency described in paragraph (b) of this section and the SEA, in order to ensure that all services described in paragraph (b)
                   (1) of this section that are needed to ensure FAPE are provided, including the provision of these services during the
                   pendency of any dispute under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The agreement or mechanism must include the following:

                   (1) An identification of, or a method for defining, the financial responsibility of each agency for providing services
                         described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to ensure FAPE to children with disabilities. The financial responsibility of
                         each noneducational public agency described in paragraph (b) of this section, including the State Medicaid agency
                         and other public insurers of children with disabilities, must precede the financial responsibility of the LEA (or the State
                         agency responsible for developing the child's IEP).

                   (2) The conditions, terms, and procedures under which an LEA must be reimbursed by other agencies.

                   (3) Procedures for resolving interagency disputes (including procedures under which LEAs may initiate proceedings)
                         under the agreement or other mechanism to secure reimbursement from other agencies or otherwise implement the
                         provisions of the agreement or mechanism.

                   (4) Policies and procedures for agencies to determine and identify the interagency coordination responsibilities of each
                         agency to promote the coordination and timely and appropriate delivery of services described in paragraph (b)(1) of
                         this section.

             (b) Obligation of noneducational public agencies.

                   (1)

                          (i)    If any public agency other than an educational agency is otherwise obligated under Federal or State law, or
                                 assigned responsibility under State policy or pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to provide or pay for any
                                 services that are also considered special education or related services (such as, but not limited to, services
                                 described in § 300.5 relating to assistive technology devices, § 300.6 relating to assistive technology services, §
                                 300.34 relating to related services, § 300.42 relating to supplementary aids and services, and § 300.43 relating to
                                 transition services) that are necessary for ensuring FAPE to children with disabilities within the State, the public
                                 agency must fulfill that obligation or responsibility, either directly or through contract or other arrangement
                                 pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or an agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

                          (ii)   A noneducational public agency described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may not disqualify an eligible
                                 service for Medicaid reimbursement because that service is provided in a school context.

                   (2) If a public agency other than an educational agency fails to provide or pay for the special education and related
                         services described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the LEA (or State agency responsible for developing the child's
                         IEP) must provide or pay for these services to the child in a timely manner. The LEA or State agency is authorized to
                         claim reimbursement for the services from the noneducational public agency that failed to provide or pay for these
                         services and that agency must reimburse the LEA or State agency in accordance with the terms of the interagency
                         agreement or other mechanism described in paragraph (a) of this section.

             (c)   Special rule. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may be met through—

                   (1) State statute or regulation;

                   (2) Signed agreements between respective agency officials that clearly identify the responsibilities of each agency relating
                         to the provision of services; or

                   (3) Other appropriate written methods as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the State or designee of that officer
                         and approved by the Secretary.

             (d) Children with disabilities who are covered by public benefits or insurance.

                   (1) A public agency may use the Medicaid or other public benefits or insurance programs in which a child participates to
                         provide or pay for services required under this part, as permitted under the public benefits or insurance program,
                         except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

                   (2) With regard to services required to provide FAPE to an eligible child under this part, the public agency—

                          (i)    May not require parents to sign up for or enroll in public benefits or insurance programs in order for their child to
                                 receive FAPE under Part B of the Act;

                          (ii)   May not require parents to incur an out-of-pocket expense such as the payment of a deductible or co-pay amount
                                 incurred in filing a claim for services provided pursuant to this part, but pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this
                                 section, may pay the cost that the parents otherwise would be required to pay;

                         (iii) May not use a child's benefits under a public benefits or insurance program if that use would—

                                 (A) Decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured benefit;

                                 (B) Result in the family paying for services that would otherwise be covered by the public benefits or insurance
                                      program and that are required for the child outside of the time the child is in school;

                                 (C) Increase premiums or lead to the discontinuation of benefits or insurance; or

                                 (D) Risk loss of eligibility for home and community-based waivers, based on aggregate health-related
                                      expenditures; and

                                      identifiable information that may be disclosed (e.g., records or information about the services that may be
                                      provided to a particular child), the purpose of the disclosure (e.g., billing for services under part 300), and

                                      the agency to which the disclosure may be made (e.g., the State's public benefits or insurance program (e.g.,
                                      Medicaid)); and
                                 (B) Specifies that the parent understands and agrees that the public agency may access the parent's or child's
                                      public benefits or insurance to pay for services under part 300.
                          (v)    Prior to accessing a child's or parent's public benefits or insurance for the first time, and annually thereafter, must
                                 provide written notification, consistent with § 300.503(c), to the child's parents, that includes—

                                 (B) A statement of the “no cost” provisions in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section;

                          (ii)   Inform the parents that their refusal to permit the public agency to access their private insurance does not relieve
                                 the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at no cost to the parents.

             (f)   Use of Part B funds.

                         public agency may use its Part B funds to pay for the service.

                   (2) To avoid financial cost to parents who otherwise would consent to use private insurance, or public benefits or
                         insurance if the parents would incur a cost, the public agency may use its Part B funds to pay the cost that the parents
                         otherwise would have to pay to use the parents' benefits or insurance (e.g., the deductible or co-pay amounts).

             (g) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance.

                   (1) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance will not be treated as program income for purposes of

                   (2) If a public agency spends reimbursements from Federal funds (e.g., Medicaid) for services under this part, those funds
                         will not be considered “State or local” funds for purposes of the maintenance of effort provisions in §§ 300.163 and
                         300.203.

             (d) Policy. In implementing this section, a State must adopt a policy that includes a requirement that LEAs in the State take
                   measurable steps to recruit, hire, train, and retain personnel who meet the applicable requirements described in paragraph
                   (c) of this section to provide special education and related services under this part to children with disabilities.

       § 300.157 Performance goals and indicators.
       The State must—


             (a) Have in effect established goals for the performance of children with disabilities in the State that—

                   (1) Promote the purposes of this part, as stated in § 300.1;

                   (2) Are the same as the State's long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for children with disabilities under
                         section 1111(c)(4)(A)(i) of the ESEA.

                   (3) Address graduation rates and dropout rates, as well as such other factors as the State may determine; and

                   (4) Are consistent, to the extent appropriate, with any other goals and academic standards for children established by the
                         State;

             (b) Have in effect established performance indicators the State will use to assess progress toward achieving the goals
                   described in paragraph (a) of this section, including measurements of interim progress for children with disabilities under
                   section 1111(c)(4)(A)(i)(cc) of the ESEA, 20 U.S.C. 6311; and

             (c)   Annually report to the Secretary and the public on the progress of the State, and of children with disabilities in the State,
                   toward meeting the goals established under paragraph (a) of this section, which may include elements of the reports
                   required under section 1111(h) of the ESEA.

       §§ 300.158-300.159 [Reserved]


       § 300.160 Participation in assessments.
             (a) General. A State must ensure that all children with disabilities are included in all general State and district-wide assessment
                   programs, including assessments described under section 1111 of the ESEA, 20 U.S.C. 6311, with appropriate
                   accommodations and alternate assessments, if necessary, as indicated in their respective IEPs.

             (b) Accommodation guidelines.

                   (1) A State (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must develop guidelines for the provision of appropriate
                         accommodations.

                   (2) The State's (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, the LEA's) guidelines must—

                          (i)   Identify only those accommodations for each assessment that do not invalidate the score; and


https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300                                                                                    46/226
5/20/25, 6:09 PM                                       eCFR :: 34 CFR Part 300 -- Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities
                          (ii)   Instruct IEP Teams to select, for each assessment, only those accommodations that do not invalidate the score.
             (c)   Alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant
                   cognitive disabilities.

                   (1) If a State has adopted alternate academic achievement standards for children with disabilities who are students with
                         the most significant cognitive disabilities as permitted in section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the ESEA, the State (or, in the case
                         of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must develop and implement alternate assessments and guidelines for the
                         participation in alternate assessments of those children with disabilities who cannot participate in regular
                         assessments, even with accommodations, as indicated in their respective IEPs, as provided in paragraph (a) of this
                         section.

                   (2) For assessing the academic progress of children with disabilities who are students with the most significant cognitive
                         disabilities under title I of the ESEA, the alternate assessments and guidelines in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must
                         —

                          (i)    Be aligned with the challenging State academic content standards under section 1111(b)(1) of the ESEA and
                                 alternate academic achievement standards under section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the ESEA; and

                          (ii)   Measure the achievement of children with disabilities who are students with the most significant cognitive
                                 disabilities against those standards.

                   (3) Consistent with section 1111(b)(1)(E)(ii) of the ESEA and 34 CFR 200.6(c)(6), a State may not adopt modified
                         academic achievement standards or any other alternate academic achievement standards that do not meet the
                         requirements in section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the ESEA for any children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the IDEA.

             (d) Explanation to IEP Teams. A State (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must—

                   (1) Provide to IEP teams a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic
                         achievement standards and those based on alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State
                         and local policies on a student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment aligned with alternate
                         academic achievement standards, such as how participation in such assessments may delay or otherwise affect the
                         student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma; and

                   (2) Not preclude a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities who takes an alternate assessment aligned with
                         alternate academic achievement standards from attempting to complete the requirements for a regular high school
                         diploma.

             (e)   Inform parents. A State (or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must ensure that parents of students selected
                   to be assessed using an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards under the State's
                   guidelines in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are informed, consistent with 34 CFR 200.2(e), that their child's achievement
                   will be measured based on alternate academic achievement standards, and of how participation in such assessments may
                   delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma.

             (f)   Reports. An SEA (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must make available to the public, and report to the
                   public with the same frequency and in the same detail as it reports on the assessment of nondisabled children, the
                   following:

                   (1) The number of children with disabilities participating in regular assessments, and the number of those children who
                         were provided accommodations (that did not result in an invalid score) in order to participate in those assessments.

                   (2) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating in alternate assessments based on grade-level academic
                         achievement standards in school years prior to 2017-2018.

                   (3) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating in alternate assessments aligned with modified academic
                         achievement standards in school years prior to 2016-2017.

                   (4) The number of children with disabilities who are students with the most significant cognitive disabilities participating
                         in alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards.

                   (5) Compared with the achievement of all children, including children with disabilities, the performance results of children
                         with disabilities on regular assessments, alternate assessments based on grade-level academic achievement
                         standards (prior to 2017-2018), alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards (prior to
                         2016-2017), and alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards if—

                          (i)    The number of children participating in those assessments is sufficient to yield statistically reliable information;
                                 and

                          (ii)   Reporting that information will not reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student on those
                                 assessments.
             (g) Universal design. An SEA (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must, to the extent possible, use universal
                   design principles in developing and administering any assessments under this section.

       § 300.162 Supplementation of State, local, and other Federal funds.
             (a) Expenditures. Funds paid to a State under this part must be expended in accordance with all the provisions of this part.

             (b) Prohibition against commingling.

                   (1) Funds paid to a State under this part must not be commingled with State funds.

                   (2) The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is satisfied by the use of a separate accounting system that
                         includes an audit trail of the expenditure of funds paid to a State under this part. Separate bank accounts are not
                         required. (See 34 CFR 76.702 (Fiscal control and fund accounting procedures).)

             (c)   State-level nonsupplanting.

                   (1) Except as provided in § 300.203, funds paid to a State under Part B of the Act must be used to supplement the level of
                         Federal, State, and local funds (including funds that are not under the direct control of the SEA or LEAs) expended for
                         special education and related services provided to children with disabilities under Part B of the Act, and in no case to
                         supplant those Federal, State, and local funds.

                   (2) If the State provides clear and convincing evidence that all children with disabilities have available to them FAPE, the
                         Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the Secretary concurs
                         with the evidence provided by the State under § 300.164.

       § 300.163 Maintenance of State financial support.
             (a) General. A State must not reduce the amount of State financial support for special education and related services for
                   children with disabilities, or otherwise made available because of the excess costs of educating those children, below the
                   amount of that support for the preceding fiscal year.

             (b) Reduction of funds for failure to maintain support. The Secretary reduces the allocation of funds under section 611 of the
                   Act for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State fails to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of
                   this section by the same amount by which the State fails to meet the requirement.

             (c)   Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances. The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this
                   section for a State, for one fiscal year at a time, if the Secretary determines that—

                   (1) Granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or
                         a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State; or

                   (2) The State meets the standard in § 300.164 for a waiver of the requirement to supplement, and not to supplant, funds
                         received under Part B of the Act.

             (d) Subsequent years. If, for any fiscal year, a State fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, including any
                   year for which the State is granted a waiver under paragraph (c) of this section, the financial support required of the State in
                   future years under paragraph (a) of this section shall be the amount that would have been required in the absence of that
                   failure and not the reduced level of the State's support.

       § 300.164 Waiver of requirement regarding supplementing and not supplanting with Part B funds.
             (a) Except as provided under §§ 300.202 through 300.205, funds paid to a State under Part B of the Act must be used to
                   supplement and increase the level of Federal, State, and local funds (including funds that are not under the direct control of
                   SEAs or LEAs) expended for special education and related services provided to children with disabilities under Part B of the
                   Act and in no case to supplant those Federal, State, and local funds. A State may use funds it retains under § 300.704(a)
                   and (b) without regard to the prohibition on supplanting other funds.

             (b) If a State provides clear and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities throughout the State have FAPE
                   available to them, the Secretary may waive for a period of one year in whole or in part the requirement under § 300.162
                   (regarding State-level nonsupplanting) if the Secretary concurs with the evidence provided by the State.

             (c)   If a State wishes to request a waiver under this section, it must submit to the Secretary a written request that includes—

                   (1) An assurance that FAPE is currently available, and will remain available throughout the period that a waiver would be in
                         effect, to all eligible children with disabilities throughout the State, regardless of the public agency that is responsible
                         for providing FAPE to them. The assurance must be signed by an official who has the authority to provide that
                         assurance as it applies to all eligible children with disabilities in the State;

                   (2) All evidence that the State wishes the Secretary to consider in determining whether all eligible children with disabilities
                         have FAPE available to them, setting forth in detail—

                          (i)    The basis on which the State has concluded that FAPE is available to all eligible children in the State; and

                          (ii)   The procedures that the State will implement to ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children in the
                                 State, which must include—

                                 (A) The State's procedures under § 300.111 for ensuring that all eligible children are identified, located and
                                      evaluated;

                                 (B) The State's procedures for monitoring public agencies to ensure that they comply with all requirements of
                                      this part;

                                 (C) The State's complaint procedures under §§ 300.151 through 300.153; and

                                 (D) The State's hearing procedures under §§ 300.511 through 300.516 and §§ 300.530 through 300.536;

                   (3) A summary of all State and Federal monitoring reports, and State complaint decisions (see §§ 300.151 through
                         300.153) and hearing decisions (see §§ 300.511 through 300.516 and §§ 300.530 through 300.536), issued within
                         three years prior to the date of the State's request for a waiver under this section, that includes any finding that FAPE
                         has not been available to one or more eligible children, and evidence that FAPE is now available to all children
                         addressed in those reports or decisions; and

                   (4) Evidence that the State, in determining that FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the
                         State, has consulted with the State advisory panel under § 300.167.

             (d) If the Secretary determines that the request and supporting evidence submitted by the State makes a prima facie showing
                   that FAPE is, and will remain, available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, the Secretary, after notice to the
                   public throughout the State, conducts a public hearing at which all interested persons and organizations may present
                   evidence regarding the following issues:

                   (1) Whether FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State.

                   (2) Whether the State will be able to ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State

                   prohibited by law from providing for the equitable participation in special programs of children with disabilities enrolled in
                   private elementary schools and secondary schools as required by section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act, or if the Secretary
                   determines that an SEA, LEA, or other public agency has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for such equitable
                   participation then the Secretary shall, notwithstanding such provision of law, arrange for the provision of services to these
                   children through arrangements which shall be subject to the requirements of section 612(a)(10)(A) of the Act.

       § 300.191 Provisions for services under a by-pass.
             (a) Before implementing a by-pass, the Secretary consults with appropriate public and private school officials, including SEA
                   officials, in the affected State, and as appropriate, LEA or other public agency officials to consider matters such as—

                   (1) Any prohibition imposed by State law that results in the need for a by-pass; and

                   (2) The scope and nature of the services required by private school children with disabilities in the State, and the number
                         of children to be served under the by-pass.

             (b) After determining that a by-pass is required, the Secretary arranges for the provision of services to private school children
                   with disabilities in the State, LEA or other public agency in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 612(a)(10)
                   (A) of the Act and §§ 300.131 through 300.144 by providing services through one or more agreements with appropriate

             (c)   For any fiscal year that a by-pass is implemented, the Secretary determines the maximum amount to be paid to the
                   providers of services by multiplying—

                   (1) A per child amount determined by dividing the total amount received by the State under Part B of the Act for the fiscal
                         year by the number of children with disabilities served in the prior year as reported to the Secretary under section 618
                         of the Act; by

                   (2) The number of private school children with disabilities (as defined in §§ 300.8(a) and 300.130) in the State, LEA or
                         other public agency, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available, which
                         may include an estimate of the number of those children with disabilities.

             (d) The Secretary deducts from the State's allocation under Part B of the Act the amount the Secretary determines is necessary
                   to implement a by-pass and pays that amount to the provider of services. The Secretary may withhold this amount from the
                   State's allocation pending final resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a determination that a by-
                   pass must be implemented.

             (b) Excess cost requirement —

                   (1) General.

                          (i)    The excess cost requirement prevents an LEA from using funds provided under Part B of the Act to pay for all of
                                 the costs directly attributable to the education of a child with a disability, subject to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this
                                 section.

                          (ii)   The excess cost requirement does not prevent an LEA from using Part B funds to pay for all of the costs directly
                                 attributable to the education of a child with a disability in any of the ages 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20, or 21, if no local or
                                 State funds are available for nondisabled children of these ages. However, the LEA must comply with the
                                 nonsupplanting and other requirements of this part in providing the education and services for these children.

                   (2)

                          (i)    An LEA meets the excess cost requirement if it has spent at least a minimum average amount for the education
                                 of its children with disabilities before funds under Part B of the Act are used.

                          (ii)   The amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is determined in accordance with the definition of
                                 excess costs in § 300.16. That amount may not include capital outlay or debt service.

                   (3) If two or more LEAs jointly establish eligibility in accordance with § 300.223, the minimum average amount is the
                         average of the combined minimum average amounts determined in accordance with the definition of excess costs in
                         § 300.16 in those agencies for elementary or secondary school students, as the case may be.

             (a) Eligibility standard.

                   (1) For purposes of establishing the LEA's eligibility for an award for a fiscal year, the SEA must determine that the LEA
                         budgets, for the education of children with disabilities, at least the same amount, from at least one of the following
                         sources, as the LEA spent for that purpose from the same source for the most recent fiscal year for which information
                         is available:

                          (i)    Local funds only;

                          (ii)   The combination of State and local funds;

                         (iii) Local funds only on a per capita basis; or

                         (iv) The combination of State and local funds on a per capita basis.

                   (2) When determining the amount of funds that the LEA must budget to meet the requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this
                         section, the LEA may take into consideration, to the extent the information is available, the exceptions and adjustment
                         provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205 that the LEA:

                          (i)    Took in the intervening year or years between the most recent fiscal year for which information is available and
                                 the fiscal year for which the LEA is budgeting; and

                          (ii)   Reasonably expects to take in the fiscal year for which the LEA is budgeting.

                   (3) Expenditures made from funds provided by the Federal government for which the SEA is required to account to the
                         Federal government or for which the LEA is required to account to the Federal government directly or through the SEA
                         may not be considered in determining whether an LEA meets the standard in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

             (b) Compliance standard.

                   (1) Except as provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205, funds provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act must not be used to
                         reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the LEA from local funds below

                   (2) An LEA meets this standard if it does not reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities
                         made by the LEA from at least one of the following sources below the level of those expenditures from the same
                         source for the preceding fiscal year, except as provided in §§ 300.204 and 300.205:

                          (i)    Local funds only;

                         (iii) Local funds only on a per capita basis; or

                         (iv) The combination of State and local funds on a per capita basis.

                   (3) Expenditures made from funds provided by the Federal government for which the SEA is required to account to the
                         Federal government or for which the LEA is required to account to the Federal government directly or through the SEA
                         may not be considered in determining whether an LEA meets the standard in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
             (c)   Subsequent years.

                   (1) If, in the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2013 or July 1, 2014, an LEA fails to meet the requirements of § 300.203 in
                         effect at that time, the level of expenditures required of the LEA for the fiscal year subsequent to the year of the failure
                         is the amount that would have been required in the absence of that failure, not the LEA's reduced level of expenditures.

                   (2) If, in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015, an LEA fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (iii)
                         of this section and the LEA is relying on local funds only, or local funds only on a per capita basis, to meet the
                         requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the level of expenditures required of the LEA for the fiscal year
                         subsequent to the year of the failure is the amount that would have been required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (iii) in
                         the absence of that failure, not the LEA's reduced level of expenditures.

                   (3) If, in any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015, an LEA fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or
                         (iv) of this section and the LEA is relying on the combination of State and local funds, or the combination of State and
                         local funds on a per capita basis, to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the level of
                         expenditures required of the LEA for the fiscal year subsequent to the year of the failure is the amount that would have
                         been required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iv) in the absence of that failure, not the LEA's reduced level of
                         expenditures.

             (d) Consequence of failure to maintain effort. If an LEA fails to maintain its level of expenditures for the education of children
                   with disabilities in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the SEA is liable in a recovery action under section 452 of
                   the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1234a) to return to the Department, using non-Federal funds, an amount
                   equal to the amount by which the LEA failed to maintain its level of expenditures in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
                   section in that fiscal year, or the amount of the LEA's Part B subgrant in that fiscal year, whichever is lower.

       § 300.205 Adjustment to local fiscal efforts in certain fiscal years.
             (a) Amounts in excess. Notwithstanding § 300.202(a)(2) and (b) and § 300.203(b), and except as provided in paragraph (d) of
                   this section and § 300.230(e)(2), for any fiscal year for which the allocation received by an LEA under § 300.705 exceeds
                   the amount the LEA received for the previous fiscal year, the LEA may reduce the level of expenditures otherwise required by
                   § 300.203(b) by not more than 50 percent of the amount of that excess.

             (b) Use of amounts to carry out activities under ESEA. If an LEA exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the
                   LEA must use an amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures under paragraph (a) of this section to carry
                   out activities that could be supported with funds under the ESEA regardless of whether the LEA is using funds under the
                   ESEA for those activities.

             (c)   State prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if an SEA determines that an LEA is unable to establish and
                   maintain programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of section 613(a) of the Act and this part or the SEA has taken
                   action against the LEA under section 616 of the Act and subpart F of these regulations, the SEA must prohibit the LEA from
                   reducing the level of expenditures under paragraph (a) of this section for that fiscal year.

             (d) Special rule. The amount of funds expended by an LEA for early intervening services under § 300.226 shall count toward the
                   maximum amount of expenditures that the LEA may reduce under paragraph (a) of this section.

       § 300.206 Schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA.
             (a) General. Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 300.202 and 300.203 or any other provision of Part B of the Act, an LEA may
                   use funds received under Part B of the Act for any fiscal year to carry out a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the
                   ESEA, except that the amount used in any schoolwide program may not exceed—

                   (1)

                          (i)    The amount received by the LEA under Part B of the Act for that fiscal year; divided by

                          (ii)   The number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of the LEA; and multiplied by

                   (2) The number of children with disabilities participating in the schoolwide program.

             (b) Funding conditions. The funds described in paragraph (a) of this section are subject to the following conditions:

                   (1) The funds must be considered as Federal Part B funds for purposes of the calculations required by § 300.202(a)(2)
                         and (a)(3).

                   (2) The funds may be used without regard to the requirements of § 300.202(a)(1).

             (c)   Meeting other Part B requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all other requirements of Part B of
                   the Act must be met by an LEA using Part B funds in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, including ensuring that
                   children with disabilities in schoolwide program schools—

                   (1) Receive services in accordance with a properly developed IEP; and

                   used for the following activities:

                   (1) Services and aids that also benefit nondisabled children. For the costs of special education and related services, and
                         supplementary aids and services, provided in a regular class or other education-related setting to a child with a
                         disability in accordance with the IEP of the child, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from these services.

                   (2) Early intervening services. To develop and implement coordinated, early intervening educational services in accordance
                         with § 300.226.

                   (3) High cost special education and related services. To establish and implement cost or risk sharing funds, consortia, or
                         cooperatives for the LEA itself, or for LEAs working in a consortium of which the LEA is a part, to pay for high cost
                         special education and related services.

             (b) Administrative case management. An LEA may use funds received under Part B of the Act to purchase appropriate
                   technology for recordkeeping, data collection, and related case management activities of teachers and related services
                   personnel providing services described in the IEP of children with disabilities, that is needed for the implementation of

       § 300.209 Treatment of charter schools and their students.
             (a) Rights of children with disabilities. Children with disabilities who attend public charter schools and their parents retain all
                   rights under this part.

             (b) Charter schools that are public schools of the LEA.

                   (1) In carrying out Part B of the Act and these regulations with respect to charter schools that are public schools of the
                         LEA, the LEA must—

                          (i)    Serve children with disabilities attending those charter schools in the same manner as the LEA serves children
                                 with disabilities in its other schools, including providing supplementary and related services on site at the charter
                                 school to the same extent to which the LEA has a policy or practice of providing such services on the site to its
                                 other public schools; and

                          (ii)   Provide funds under Part B of the Act to those charter schools—

                                 (A) On the same basis as the LEA provides funds to the LEA's other public schools, including proportional
                                      distribution based on relative enrollment of children with disabilities; and
https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300                                                                                    65/226

                                 (B) At the same time as the LEA distributes other Federal funds to the LEA's other public schools, consistent
                                      with the State's charter school law.
                   (2) If the public charter school is a school of an LEA that receives funding under § 300.705 and includes other public
                         schools—

                          (i)    The LEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this part are met, unless State law assigns that
                                 responsibility to some other entity; and

                          (ii)   The LEA must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
             (c)   Public charter schools that are LEAs. If the public charter school is an LEA, consistent with § 300.28, that receives funding
                   under § 300.705, that charter school is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this part are met, unless State law
                   assigns that responsibility to some other entity.

             (d) Public charter schools that are not an LEA or a school that is part of an LEA.

                   (1) If the public charter school is not an LEA receiving funding under § 300.705, or a school that is part of an LEA receiving
                         funding under § 300.705, the SEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this part are met.

                   (2) Paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not preclude a State from assigning initial responsibility for ensuring the
                         requirements of this part are met to another entity. However, the SEA must maintain the ultimate responsibility for
                         ensuring compliance with this part, consistent with § 300.149.

             (a) General. Not later than December 3, 2006, an LEA that chooses to coordinate with the National Instructional Materials
                   Access Center (NIMAC), when purchasing print instructional materials, must acquire those instructional materials in the

                         print disabilities in § 300.172(e)(1)(i) or who need materials that cannot be produced from NIMAS files, receive those

       § 300.220 Exception for prior local plans.
             (a) General. If an LEA or a State agency described in § 300.228 has on file with the SEA policies and procedures that
                   demonstrate that the LEA or State agency meets any requirement of § 300.200, including any policies and procedures filed
                   under Part B of the Act as in effect before December 3, 2004, the SEA must consider the LEA or State agency to have met
                   that requirement for purposes of receiving assistance under Part B of the Act.

             (b) Modification made by an LEA or State agency. Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, policies and procedures submitted by
                   an LEA or a State agency in accordance with this subpart remain in effect until the LEA or State agency submits to the SEA
                   the modifications that the LEA or State agency determines are necessary.

             (c)   Modifications required by the SEA. The SEA may require an LEA or a State agency to modify its policies and procedures, but
                   only to the extent necessary to ensure the LEA's or State agency's compliance with Part B of the Act or State law, if—

                   (1) After December 3, 2004, the effective date of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the
                         applicable provisions of the Act (or the regulations developed to carry out the Act) are amended;

                   (2) There is a new interpretation of an applicable provision of the Act by Federal or State courts; or

             (a) General. If the SEA, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, finds that an LEA or State agency that has been
                   determined to be eligible under this subpart is failing to comply with any requirement described in §§ 300.201 through
                   300.213, the SEA must reduce or must not provide any further payments to the LEA or State agency until the SEA is
                   satisfied that the LEA or State agency is complying with that requirement.

             (b) Notice requirement. Any State agency or LEA in receipt of a notice described in paragraph (a) of this section must, by means
                   of public notice, take the measures necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this section to the attention of
                   the public within the jurisdiction of the agency.

             (c)   Consideration. In carrying out its responsibilities under this section, each SEA must consider any decision resulting from a

       § 300.223 Joint establishment of eligibility.
             (a) General. An SEA may require an LEA to establish its eligibility jointly with another LEA if the SEA determines that the LEA will
                   be ineligible under this subpart because the agency will not be able to establish and maintain programs of sufficient size
                   and scope to effectively meet the needs of children with disabilities.

             (b) Charter school exception. An SEA may not require a charter school that is an LEA to jointly establish its eligibility under
                   paragraph (a) of this section unless the charter school is explicitly permitted to do so under the State's charter school
                   statute.

             (c)   Amount of payments. If an SEA requires the joint establishment of eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, the total
                   amount of funds made available to the affected LEAs must be equal to the sum of the payments that each LEA would have
                   received under § 300.705 if the agencies were eligible for those payments.

                   (1) Adopt policies and procedures that are consistent with the State's policies and procedures under §§ 300.101 through
                         300.163, and §§ 300.165 through 300.174; and

                   (2) Be jointly responsible for implementing programs that receive assistance under Part B of the Act.

             (b) Requirements for educational service agencies in general. If an educational service agency is required by State law to carry
                   out programs under Part B of the Act, the joint responsibilities given to LEAs under Part B of the Act—

                   (2) Must be carried out only by that educational service agency.

             (c)   Additional requirement. Notwithstanding any other provision of §§ 300.223 through 300.224, an educational service agency
                   must provide for the education of children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment, as required by § 300.112.

       § 300.225 [Reserved]


       § 300.226 Early intervening services.
             (a) General. An LEA may not use more than 15 percent of the amount the LEA receives under Part B of the Act for any fiscal
                   year, less any amount reduced by the LEA pursuant to § 300.205, if any, in combination with other amounts (which may
                   include amounts other than education funds), to develop and implement coordinated, early intervening services, which may
                   include interagency financing structures, for students in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a particular emphasis on
                   students in kindergarten through grade three) who are not currently identified as needing special education or related
                   services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment. (See
                   appendix D for examples of how § 300.205(d), regarding local maintenance of effort, and § 300.226(a) affect one another.)

             (b) Activities. In implementing coordinated, early intervening services under this section, an LEA may carry out activities that
                   include—

                   (1) Professional development (which may be provided by entities other than LEAs) for teachers and other school staff to
                         enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behavioral interventions, including scientifically
                         based literacy instruction, and, where appropriate, instruction on the use of adaptive and instructional software; and

                   (2) Providing educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports, including scientifically based literacy
                         instruction.

             (c)   Construction. Nothing in this section shall be construed to either limit or create a right to FAPE under Part B of the Act or to
                   delay appropriate evaluation of a child suspected of having a disability.

             (d) Reporting. Each LEA that develops and maintains coordinated, early intervening services under this section must annually
                   report to the SEA on—

                   (1) The number of children served under this section who received early intervening services; and

                   (2) The number of children served under this section who received early intervening services and subsequently receive
                         special education and related services under Part B of the Act during the preceding two year period.

             (e)   Coordination with ESEA. Funds made available to carry out this section may be used to carry out coordinated, early
                   intervening services aligned with activities funded by, and carried out under the ESEA if those funds are used to
                   supplement, and not supplant, funds made available under the ESEA for the activities and services assisted under this
                   section.

       § 300.227 Direct services by the SEA.
             (a) General.

                   (1) An SEA must use the payments that would otherwise have been available to an LEA or to a State agency to provide
                         special education and related services directly to children with disabilities residing in the area served by that LEA, or
                         for whom that State agency is responsible, if the SEA determines that the LEA or State agency—

                          (i)    Has not provided the information needed to establish the eligibility of the LEA or State agency, or elected not to
                                 apply for its Part B allotment, under Part B of the Act;

                          (ii)   Is unable to establish and maintain programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of this part;

                         (iii) Is unable or unwilling to be consolidated with one or more LEAs in order to establish and maintain the programs;
                                 or

                         (iv) Has one or more children with disabilities who can best be served by a regional or State program or service
                                 delivery system designed to meet the needs of these children.

                   (2) SEA administrative procedures.

                          (i)    In meeting the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the SEA may provide special education and
                                 related services directly, by contract, or through other arrangements.

                          (ii)   The excess cost requirements of § 300.202(b) do not apply to the SEA.

             (b) Manner and location of education and services. The SEA may provide special education and related services under
                   paragraph (a) of this section in the manner and at the locations (including regional or State centers) as the SEA considers
                   appropriate. The education and services must be provided in accordance with this part.

       § 300.228 State agency eligibility.
       Any State agency that desires to receive a subgrant for any fiscal year under § 300.705 must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
       SEA that—


             (a) All children with disabilities who are participating in programs and projects funded under Part B of the Act receive FAPE, and
                   that those children and their parents are provided all the rights and procedural safeguards described in this part; and

             (b) The agency meets the other conditions of this subpart that apply to LEAs.

             (a) The State may require that a public agency include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of any current or
                   previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child and transmit the statement to the same extent that the
                   disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children.

             (b) The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a
                   description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other
                   individuals involved with the child.

             (c)   If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from one school to another, the transmission of any of the child's
                   records must include both the child's current IEP and any statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has been
                   taken against the child.

       § 300.230 SEA flexibility.
             (a) Adjustment to State fiscal effort in certain fiscal years. For any fiscal year for which the allotment received by a State under §
                   300.703 exceeds the amount the State received for the previous fiscal year and if the State in school year 2003-2004 or any
                   subsequent school year pays or reimburses all LEAs within the State from State revenue 100 percent of the non-Federal
                   share of the costs of special education and related services, the SEA, notwithstanding §§ 300.162 through 300.163 (related
                   to State-level nonsupplanting and maintenance of effort), and § 300.175 (related to direct services by the SEA) may reduce
                   the level of expenditures from State sources for the education of children with disabilities by not more than 50 percent of
                   the amount of such excess.

             (b) Prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the Secretary determines that an SEA is unable to establish,
                   maintain, or oversee programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of this part, or that the State needs assistance,
                   intervention, or substantial intervention under § 300.603, the Secretary prohibits the SEA from exercising the authority in
                   paragraph (a) of this section.

             (c)   Education activities. If an SEA exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must use funds from
                   State sources, in an amount equal to the amount of the reduction under paragraph (a) of this section, to support activities
                   authorized under the ESEA, or to support need-based student or teacher higher education programs.

             (d) Report. For each fiscal year for which an SEA exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must
                   report to the Secretary—

                   (1) The amount of expenditures reduced pursuant to that paragraph; and

                   (2) The activities that were funded pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

             (e)   Limitation.

                   (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an SEA may not reduce the level of expenditures described in paragraph
                         (a) of this section if any LEA in the State would, as a result of such reduction, receive less than 100 percent of the
                         amount necessary to ensure that all children with disabilities served by the LEA receive FAPE from the combination of
                         Federal funds received under Part B of the Act and State funds received from the SEA.

                   (2) If an SEA exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, LEAs in the State may not reduce local effort
                         under § 300.205 by more than the reduction in the State funds they receive.

                          (i)    The public agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a
                                 disability under § 300.8 must, after providing notice consistent with §§ 300.503 and 300.504, obtain informed
                                 consent, consistent with § 300.9, from the parent of the child before conducting the evaluation.

                          (ii)   Parental consent for initial evaluation must not be construed as consent for initial provision of special education
                                 and related services.

                         (iii) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent from the parent for an initial
                                 evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability.
                   (2) For initial evaluations only, if the child is a ward of the State and is not residing with the child's parent, the public
                         agency is not required to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine whether the
                         child is a child with a disability if—

                          (i)    Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the public agency cannot discover the whereabouts of the parent of the child;

                          (ii)   The rights of the parents of the child have been terminated in accordance with State law; or

                         (iii) The rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State
                                 law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the
                                 child.

                   (3)

                          (i)    If the parent of a child enrolled in public school or seeking to be enrolled in public school does not provide
                                 consent for initial evaluation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the parent fails to respond to a request to
                                 provide consent, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by utilizing
                                 the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the
                                 due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516), if appropriate, except to the extent inconsistent
                                 with State law relating to such parental consent.

                          (ii)   The public agency does not violate its obligation under § 300.111 and §§ 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines
                                 to pursue the evaluation.
             (b) Parental consent for services.

                   (1) A public agency that is responsible for making FAPE available to a child with a disability must obtain informed consent
                         from the parent of the child before the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.

                   (2) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of
                         special education and related services to the child.

                   (3) If the parent of a child fails to respond to a request for, or refuses to consent to, the initial provision of special
                         education and related services, the public agency—

                          (i)    May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the
                                 due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the
                                 services may be provided to the child;

                          (ii)   Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the child because of the
                                 failure to provide the child with the special education and related services for which the parent refuses to or fails
                                 to provide consent; and

                         (iii) Is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP under §§ 300.320 and 300.324 for the child.

                   (4) If, at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the parent of a child revokes
                         consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and related services, the public agency—

                          (i)    May not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must provide prior written
                                 notice in accordance with § 300.503 before ceasing the provision of special education and related services;

                          (ii)   May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the
                                 due process procedures under §§ 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the
                                 services may be provided to the child;

                         (iii) Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the child because of the
                                 failure to provide the child with further special education and related services; and

                   (1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each public agency—

                          (i)    Must obtain informed parental consent, in accordance with § 300.300(a)(1), prior to conducting any reevaluation
                                 of a child with a disability.

                          (ii)   If the parent refuses to consent to the reevaluation, the public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the
                                 reevaluation by using the consent override procedures described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

                         (iii) The public agency does not violate its obligation under § 300.111 and §§ 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines
                                 to pursue the evaluation or reevaluation.

                   (2) The informed parental consent described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section need not be obtained if the public agency
                         can demonstrate that—

                          (i)    It made reasonable efforts to obtain such consent; and

                          (ii)   The child's parent has failed to respond.

             (d) Other consent requirements.

                   (1) Parental consent is not required before—

                          (i)    Reviewing existing data as part of an evaluation or a reevaluation; or

                          (ii)   Administering a test or other evaluation that is administered to all children unless, before administration of that
                                 test or evaluation, consent is required of parents of all children.

                   (2) In addition to the parental consent requirements described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a State may
                         require parental consent for other services and activities under this part if it ensures that each public agency in the
                         State establishes and implements effective procedures to ensure that a parent's refusal to consent does not result in a
                         failure to provide the child with FAPE.

                   (3) A public agency may not use a parent's refusal to consent to one service or activity under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (d)
                         (2) of this section to deny the parent or child any other service, benefit, or activity of the public agency, except as
                         required by this part.

                                 not provide consent for the initial evaluation or the reevaluation, or the parent fails to respond to a request to
                                 provide consent, the public agency may not use the consent override procedures (described in paragraphs (a)(3)
                                 and (c)(1) of this section); and

                          (ii)   The public agency is not required to consider the child as eligible for services under §§ 300.132 through 300.144.

                   (5) To meet the reasonable efforts requirement in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii), (a)(2)(i), (b)(2), and (c)(2)(i) of this section, the
                         public agency must document its attempts to obtain parental consent using the procedures in § 300.322(d).

       § 300.301 Initial evaluations.
             (a) General. Each public agency must conduct a full and individual initial evaluation, in accordance with §§ 300.304 through
                   300.306, before the initial provision of special education and related services to a child with a disability under this part.

             (b) Request for initial evaluation. Consistent with the consent requirements in § 300.300, either a parent of a child or a public
                   agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability.

             (c)   Procedures for initial evaluation. The initial evaluation—

                   (1)

                          (i)    Must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation; or

                          (ii)   If the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be conducted, within that timeframe; and

                   (2) Must consist of procedures—

                          (i)    To determine if the child is a child with a disability under § 300.8; and

                          (ii)   To determine the educational needs of the child.
             (d) Exception. The timeframe described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a public agency if—

                   (1) The parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the child for the evaluation; or

                   (2) A child enrolls in a school of another public agency after the relevant timeframe in paragraph (c)(1) of this section has
                         begun, and prior to a determination by the child's previous public agency as to whether the child is a child with a
                         disability under § 300.8.

             (e) The exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies only if the subsequent public agency is making sufficient progress
                   to ensure a prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and subsequent public agency agree to a specific time
                   when the evaluation will be completed.

       § 300.302 Screening for instructional purposes is not evaluation.
       The screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum implementation

       § 300.303 Reevaluations.
             (a) General. A public agency must ensure that a reevaluation of each child with a disability is conducted in accordance with §§
                   300.304 through 300.311—

                   (1) If the public agency determines that the educational or related services needs, including improved academic
                         achievement and functional performance, of the child warrant a reevaluation; or

                   (2) If the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.

             (b) Limitation. A reevaluation conducted under paragraph (a) of this section—

                   (1) May occur not more than once a year, unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise; and

                   (2) Must occur at least once every 3 years, unless the parent and the public agency agree that a reevaluation is
                         unnecessary.

       § 300.304 Evaluation procedures.
             (a) Notice. The public agency must provide notice to the parents of a child with a disability, in accordance with § 300.503, that
                   describes any evaluation procedures the agency proposes to conduct.

             (b) Conduct of evaluation. In conducting the evaluation, the public agency must—

                   (1) Use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic
                         information about the child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining—

                          (i)    Whether the child is a child with a disability under § 300.8; and

                          (ii)   The content of the child's IEP, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in
                                 the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child, to participate in appropriate activities);
                   (2) Not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a
                         disability and for determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and

                   (3) Use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in
                         addition to physical or developmental factors.
             (c)   Other evaluation procedures. Each public agency must ensure that—

                   (1) Assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under this part—

                          (i)    Are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis;

                          (ii)   Are provided and administered in the child's native language or other mode of communication and in the form
                                 most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and
                                 functionally, unless it is clearly not feasible to so provide or administer;

                         (iii) Are used for the purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable;

                         (iv) Are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and

                          (v)    Are administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessments.

                   (2) Assessments and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and
                         not merely those that are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient.

                   (3) Assessments are selected and administered so as best to ensure that if an assessment is administered to a child with
                         impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the assessment results accurately reflect the child's aptitude or
                         achievement level or whatever other factors the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired
                         sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

                   (4) The child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing,
                         social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, communicative status, and motor abilities;

                   (5) Assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from one public agency to another public agency in the same
                         school year are coordinated with those children's prior and subsequent schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as
                         possible, consistent with § 300.301(d)(2) and (e), to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations.

                   (6) In evaluating each child with a disability under §§ 300.304 through 300.306, the evaluation is sufficiently
                         comprehensive to identify all of the child's special education and related services needs, whether or not commonly
                         linked to the disability category in which the child has been classified.

                   (7) Assessment tools and strategies that provide relevant information that directly assists persons in determining the
                         educational needs of the child are provided.

       § 300.305 Additional requirements for evaluations and reevaluations.
             (a) Review of existing evaluation data. As part of an initial evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this
                   part, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, must—

                   (1) Review existing evaluation data on the child, including—

                          (i)    Evaluations and information provided by the parents of the child;

                          (ii)   Current classroom-based, local, or State assessments, and classroom-based observations; and

                         (iii) Observations by teachers and related services providers; and

                                 (B) In case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues to have such a disability, and the educational
                                      needs of the child;
                          (ii)   The present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the child;

                         (iii)

                                 (A) Whether the child needs special education and related services; or

                                 (B) In the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues to need special education and related
                                      services; and

                         (iv) Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the
                                 child to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to participate, as appropriate, in the
                                 general education curriculum.
             (b) Conduct of review. The group described in paragraph (a) of this section may conduct its review without a meeting.

             (c)   Source of data. The public agency must administer such assessments and other evaluation measures as may be needed to
                   produce the data identified under paragraph (a) of this section.

             (d) Requirements if additional data are not needed.

                   (1) If the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, determine that no additional data are needed to
                         determine whether the child continues to be a child with a disability, and to determine the child's educational needs,
                         the public agency must notify the child's parents of—

                          (i)    That determination and the reasons for the determination; and

                          (ii)   The right of the parents to request an assessment to determine whether the child continues to be a child with a
                                 disability, and to determine the child's educational needs.

                   (2) The public agency is not required to conduct the assessment described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section unless
                         requested to do so by the child's parents.

             (e)   Evaluations before change in eligibility.

                   (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a public agency must evaluate a child with a disability in
                         accordance with §§ 300.304 through 300.311 before determining that the child is no longer a child with a disability.

                   (2) The evaluation described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not required before the termination of a child's eligibility
                         under this part due to graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility
                         for FAPE under State law.

                   (1) In interpreting evaluation data for the purpose of determining if a child is a child with a disability under § 300.8, and the
                         educational needs of the child, each public agency must—

                          (i)    Draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent input, and
                                 teacher recommendations, as well as information about the child's physical condition, social or cultural
                                 background, and adaptive behavior; and

                          (ii)   Ensure that information obtained from all of these sources is documented and carefully considered.

                   (2) If a determination is made that a child has a disability and needs special education and related services, an IEP must
                         be developed for the child in accordance with §§ 300.320 through 300.324.

       § 300.307 Specific learning disabilities.
             (a) General. A State must adopt, consistent with § 300.309, criteria for determining whether a child has a specific learning
                   disability as defined in § 300.8(c)(10). In addition, the criteria adopted by the State—

                   (1) Must not require the use of a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement for determining whether
                         a child has a specific learning disability, as defined in § 300.8(c)(10);

                   (2) Must permit the use of a process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention; and

                   (3) May permit the use of other alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific
                         learning disability, as defined in § 300.8(c)(10).

                   (1) The child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or
                         more of the following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or
                         State-approved grade-level standards:

                          (i)    Oral expression.

                                 of the areas identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when using a process based on the child's response to
                                 scientific, research-based intervention; or

                          (ii)   The child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age,
                                 State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant
                                 to the identification of a specific learning disability, using appropriate assessments, consistent with §§ 300.304
                                 and 300.305; and

                   (3) The group determines that its findings under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are not primarily the result of—

                         (vi) Limited English proficiency.
             (b) To ensure that underachievement in a child suspected of having a specific learning disability is not due to lack of
                   appropriate instruction in reading or math, the group must consider, as part of the evaluation described in §§ 300.304
                   through 300.306—

                   (1) Data that demonstrate that prior to, or as a part of, the referral process, the child was provided appropriate instruction
                         in regular education settings, delivered by qualified personnel; and

                   (2) Data-based documentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals, reflecting formal
                         assessment of student progress during instruction, which was provided to the child's parents.

             (c) The public agency must promptly request parental consent to evaluate the child to determine if the child needs special
                   education and related services, and must adhere to the timeframes described in §§ 300.301 and 300.303, unless extended
                   by mutual written agreement of the child's parents and a group of qualified professionals, as described in § 300.306(a)(1)—

                   (1) If, prior to a referral, a child has not made adequate progress after an appropriate period of time when provided
                         instruction, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section; and

                   (2) Whenever a child is referred for an evaluation.

                         preferences and interests are considered.

                   (3) To the extent appropriate, with the consent of the parents or a child who has reached the age of majority, in
                         implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the public agency must invite a representative of
                         any participating agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services.

             (c)   Determination of knowledge and special expertise. The determination of the knowledge or special expertise of any individual
                   described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be made by the party (parents or public agency) who invited the
                   individual to be a member of the IEP Team.

             (d) Designating a public agency representative. A public agency may designate a public agency member of the IEP Team to also
                   serve as the agency representative, if the criteria in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are satisfied.

             (e)   IEP Team attendance.

                   (1) A member of the IEP Team described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section is not required to attend an IEP
                         Team meeting, in whole or in part, if the parent of a child with a disability and the public agency agree, in writing, that
                         the attendance of the member is not necessary because the member's area of the curriculum or related services is not
                         being modified or discussed in the meeting.

                   (2) A member of the IEP Team described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be excused from attending an IEP Team
                         meeting, in whole or in part, when the meeting involves a modification to or discussion of the member's area of the
                         curriculum or related services, if—

                          (i)    The parent, in writing, and the public agency consent to the excusal; and

                          (ii)   The member submits, in writing to the parent and the IEP Team, input into the development of the IEP prior to the
                                 meeting.

             (f)   Initial IEP Team meeting for child under Part C. In the case of a child who was previously served under Part C of the Act, an
                   invitation to the initial IEP Team meeting must, at the request of the parent, be sent to the Part C service coordinator or
                   other representatives of the Part C system to assist with the smooth transition of services.

       § 300.322 Parent participation.
             (a) Public agency responsibility—general. Each public agency must take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents of a
                   child with a disability are present at each IEP Team meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate, including—

                   (1) Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have an opportunity to attend; and

                   (2) Scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.

             (b) Information provided to parents.

                   (1) The notice required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must—

                          (i)    Indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting and who will be in attendance; and

                          (ii)   Inform the parents of the provisions in § 300.321(a)(6) and (c) (relating to the participation of other individuals on
                                 the IEP Team who have knowledge or special expertise about the child), and § 300.321(f) (relating to the
                                 participation of the Part C service coordinator or other representatives of the Part C system at the initial IEP
                                 Team meeting for a child previously served under Part C of the Act).

                   (2) For a child with a disability beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if
                         determined appropriate by the IEP Team, the notice also must—

                          (i)    Indicate—

                                 (A) That a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals and transition services
                                      for the child, in accordance with § 300.320(b); and

                                 (B) That the agency will invite the student; and

                          (ii)   Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a representative.

             (c)   Other methods to ensure parent participation. If neither parent can attend an IEP Team meeting, the public agency must use
                   other methods to ensure parent participation, including individual or conference telephone calls, consistent with § 300.328
                   (related to alternative means of meeting participation).

             (d) Conducting an IEP Team meeting without a parent in attendance. A meeting may be conducted without a parent in
                   attendance if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend. In this case, the public agency
                   must keep a record of its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed on time and place, such as—

                   (3) Detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits.
             (e)   Use of interpreters or other action, as appropriate. The public agency must take whatever action is necessary to ensure that
                   the parent understands the proceedings of the IEP Team meeting, including arranging for an interpreter for parents with
                   deafness or whose native language is other than English.

             (f)   Parent copy of child's IEP. The public agency must give the parent a copy of the child's IEP at no cost to the parent.

       § 300.323 When IEPs must be in effect.
             (a) General. At the beginning of each school year, each public agency must have in effect, for each child with a disability within
                   its jurisdiction, an IEP, as defined in § 300.320.

             (b) IEP or IFSP for children aged three through five.

                   (1) In the case of a child with a disability aged three through five (or, at the discretion of the SEA, a two-year-old child with
                         a disability who will turn age three during the school year), the IEP Team must consider an IFSP that contains the IFSP
                         content (including the natural environments statement) described in section 636(d) of the Act and its implementing
                         regulations (including an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates pre-literacy,
                         language, and numeracy skills for children with IFSPs under this section who are at least three years of age), and that
                         is developed in accordance with the IEP procedures under this part. The IFSP may serve as the IEP of the child, if using
                         the IFSP as the IEP is—

                          (i)    Consistent with State policy; and

                          (ii)   Agreed to by the agency and the child's parents.

                   (2) In implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the public agency must—

                          (i)    Provide to the child's parents a detailed explanation of the differences between an IFSP and an IEP; and

                          (ii)   If the parents choose an IFSP, obtain written informed consent from the parents.

             (c)   Initial IEPs; provision of services. Each public agency must ensure that—

                   (1) A meeting to develop an IEP for a child is conducted within 30 days of a determination that the child needs special
                         education and related services; and

                   (2) As soon as possible following development of the IEP, special education and related services are made available to the
                         child in accordance with the child's IEP.

             (d) Accessibility of child's IEP to teachers and others. Each public agency must ensure that—

                   (1) The child's IEP is accessible to each regular education teacher, special education teacher, related services provider,
                         and any other service provider who is responsible for its implementation; and

                   (2) Each teacher and provider described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is informed of—

                          (i)    His or her specific responsibilities related to implementing the child's IEP; and

                          (ii)   The specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that must be provided for the child in accordance
                                 with the IEP.

             (e)   IEPs for children who transfer public agencies in the same State. If a child with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect
                   in a previous public agency in the same State) transfers to a new public agency in the same State, and enrolls in a new
                   school within the same school year, the new public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide FAPE to the child
                   (including services comparable to those described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the new public
                   agency either—

                   (1) Adopts the child's IEP from the previous public agency; or

                   (2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP that meets the applicable requirements in §§ 300.320 through 300.324.

             (f)   IEPs for children who transfer from another State. If a child with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect in a previous
                   public agency in another State) transfers to a public agency in a new State, and enrolls in a new school within the same
                   school year, the new public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide the child with FAPE (including services

                   comparable to those described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the new public agency—

                   (1) Conducts an evaluation pursuant to §§ 300.304 through 300.306 (if determined to be necessary by the new public
                         agency); and

                   (2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP, if appropriate, that meets the applicable requirements in §§ 300.320
                         through 300.324.
             (g) Transmittal of records. To facilitate the transition for a child described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section—

                   (1) The new public agency in which the child enrolls must take reasonable steps to promptly obtain the child's records,
                         including the IEP and supporting documents and any other records relating to the provision of special education or
                         related services to the child, from the previous public agency in which the child was enrolled, pursuant to 34 CFR
                         99.31(a)(2); and

                   (2) The previous public agency in which the child was enrolled must take reasonable steps to promptly respond to the
                         request from the new public agency.

       § 300.324 Development, review, and revision of IEP.
             (a) Development of IEP —

                   (1) General. In developing each child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider—

                          (i)    The strengths of the child;

                          (ii)   The concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child;

                         (iii) The results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child; and

                         (iv) The academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child.

                   (2) Consideration of special factors. The IEP Team must—

                          (i)    In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others, consider the use of positive
                                 behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior;

                          (ii)   In the case of a child with limited English proficiency, consider the language needs of the child as those needs
                                 relate to the child's IEP;

                         (iii) In the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille
                                 unless the IEP Team determines, after an evaluation of the child's reading and writing skills, needs, and
                                 appropriate reading and writing media (including an evaluation of the child's future needs for instruction in Braille
                                 or the use of Braille), that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate for the child;

                         (iv) Consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider
                                 the child's language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and
                                 professional personnel in the child's language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs,
                                 including opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode; and

                          (v)    Consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.

                   (3) Requirement with respect to regular education teacher. A regular education teacher of a child with a disability, as a
                         member of the IEP Team, must, to the extent appropriate, participate in the development of the IEP of the child,
                         including the determination of—

                          (i)    Appropriate positive behavioral interventions and supports and other strategies for the child; and

                          (ii)   Supplementary aids and services, program modifications, and support for school personnel consistent with §
                                 300.320(a)(4).

                   (4) Agreement.

                          (i)    In making changes to a child's IEP after the annual IEP Team meeting for a school year, the parent of a child with
                                 a disability and the public agency may agree not to convene an IEP Team meeting for the purposes of making
                                 those changes, and instead may develop a written document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.

                          (ii)   If changes are made to the child's IEP in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the public agency
                                 must ensure that the child's IEP Team is informed of those changes.
                   (5) Consolidation of IEP Team meetings. To the extent possible, the public agency must encourage the consolidation of
                         reevaluation meetings for the child and other IEP Team meetings for the child.

                   (6) Amendments. Changes to the IEP may be made either by the entire IEP Team at an IEP Team meeting, or as provided in
                         paragraph (a)(4) of this section, by amending the IEP rather than by redrafting the entire IEP. Upon request, a parent
                         must be provided with a revised copy of the IEP with the amendments incorporated.
             (b) Review and revision of IEPs —

                   (1) General. Each public agency must ensure that, subject to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the IEP Team—

                          (i)    Reviews the child's IEP periodically, but not less than annually, to determine whether the annual goals for the child
                                 are being achieved; and

                          (ii)   Revises the IEP, as appropriate, to address—

                                 (A) Any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals described in § 300.320(a)(2), and in the general
                                      education curriculum, if appropriate;

                                 (B) The results of any reevaluation conducted under § 300.303;

                                 (C) Information about the child provided to, or by, the parents, as described under § 300.305(a)(2);

                                 (D) The child's anticipated needs; or

                                 (E) Other matters.

                   (2) Consideration of special factors. In conducting a review of the child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider the special
                         factors described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

                   (3) Requirement with respect to regular education teacher. A regular education teacher of the child, as a member of the IEP
                         Team, must, consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, participate in the review and revision of the IEP of the
                         child.

             (c)   Failure to meet transition objectives —

                   (1) Participating agency failure. If a participating agency, other than the public agency, fails to provide the transition
                         services described in the IEP in accordance with § 300.320(b), the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to
                         identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the child set out in the IEP.

                   (2) Construction. Nothing in this part relieves any participating agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency,
                         of the responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise provide to children
                         with disabilities who meet the eligibility criteria of that agency.

             (d) Children with disabilities in adult prisons —

                   (1) Requirements that do not apply. The following requirements do not apply to children with disabilities who are convicted
                         as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons:

                          (i)    The requirements contained in section 612(a)(16) of the Act and § 300.320(a)(6) (relating to participation of
                                 children with disabilities in general assessments).

                          (ii)   The requirements in § 300.320(b) (relating to transition planning and transition services) do not apply with
                                 respect to the children whose eligibility under Part B of the Act will end, because of their age, before they will be
                                 eligible to be released from prison based on consideration of their sentence and eligibility for early release.

                   (2) Modifications of IEP or placement.

                          (i)    Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the IEP Team of a child with a disability who is convicted as an
                                 adult under State law and incarcerated in an adult prison may modify the child's IEP or placement if the State has
                                 demonstrated a bona fide security or compelling penological interest that cannot otherwise be accommodated.

       § 300.325 Private school placements by public agencies.
             (a) Developing IEPs.

                   (1) Before a public agency places a child with a disability in, or refers a child to, a private school or facility, the agency
                         must initiate and conduct a meeting to develop an IEP for the child in accordance with §§ 300.320 and 300.324.

                   (2) The agency must ensure that a representative of the private school or facility attends the meeting. If the representative
                         cannot attend, the agency must use other methods to ensure participation by the private school or facility, including
                         individual or conference telephone calls.

             (b) Reviewing and revising IEPs.

                   (1) After a child with a disability enters a private school or facility, any meetings to review and revise the child's IEP may be
                         initiated and conducted by the private school or facility at the discretion of the public agency.

                   (2) If the private school or facility initiates and conducts these meetings, the public agency must ensure that the parents
                         and an agency representative—

                          (i)    Are involved in any decision about the child's IEP; and

                          (ii)   Agree to any proposed changes in the IEP before those changes are implemented.

             (c)   Responsibility. Even if a private school or facility implements a child's IEP, responsibility for compliance with this part
                   remains with the public agency and the SEA.

       When conducting IEP Team meetings and placement meetings pursuant to this subpart, and subpart E of this part, and carrying out
       administrative matters under section 615 of the Act (such as scheduling, exchange of witness lists, and status conferences), the
       parent of a child with a disability and a public agency may agree to use alternative means of meeting participation, such as video
       conferences and conference calls.

             (a) Opportunity to examine records. The parents of a child with a disability must be afforded, in accordance with the procedures
                   of §§ 300.613 through 300.621, an opportunity to inspect and review all education records with respect to—

                   (1) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child; and

                   (2) The provision of FAPE to the child.

             (b) Parent participation in meetings.

                   (1) The parents of a child with a disability must be afforded an opportunity to participate in meetings with respect to—

                          (i)    The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child; and

                          (ii)   The provision of FAPE to the child.

                   (2) Each public agency must provide notice consistent with § 300.322(a)(1) and (b)(1) to ensure that parents of children
                         with disabilities have the opportunity to participate in meetings described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

                   (3) A meeting does not include informal or unscheduled conversations involving public agency personnel and
                         conversations on issues such as teaching methodology, lesson plans, or coordination of service provision. A meeting
                         also does not include preparatory activities that public agency personnel engage in to develop a proposal or response
                         to a parent proposal that will be discussed at a later meeting.

             (c)   Parent involvement in placement decisions.

                   (1) Each public agency must ensure that a parent of each child with a disability is a member of any group that makes
                         decisions on the educational placement of the parent's child.

                   (2) In implementing the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the public agency must use procedures
                         consistent with the procedures described in § 300.322(a) through (b)(1).

                   (3) If neither parent can participate in a meeting in which a decision is to be made relating to the educational placement of
                         their child, the public agency must use other methods to ensure their participation, including individual or conference
                         telephone calls, or video conferencing.

                   (4) A placement decision may be made by a group without the involvement of a parent, if the public agency is unable to
                         obtain the parent's participation in the decision. In this case, the public agency must have a record of its attempt to
                         ensure their involvement.

       § 300.502 Independent educational evaluation.
             (a) General.

                   (1) The parents of a child with a disability have the right under this part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of
                         the child, subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.

                   (2) Each public agency must provide to parents, upon request for an independent educational evaluation, information
                         about where an independent educational evaluation may be obtained, and the agency criteria applicable for
                         independent educational evaluations as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

                   (3) For the purposes of this subpart—

                          (i)    Independent educational evaluation means an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed
                                 by the public agency responsible for the education of the child in question; and

                          (ii)   Public expense means that the public agency either pays for the full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the
                                 evaluation is otherwise provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with § 300.103.

             (b) Parent right to evaluation at public expense.

                   (1) A parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an
                         evaluation obtained by the public agency, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section.

                   (2) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation at public expense, the public agency must, without
                         unnecessary delay, either—


https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300                                                                                    86/226

                          (i)    File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate; or

                          (ii)   Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense, unless the agency
                                 demonstrates in a hearing pursuant to §§ 300.507 through 300.513 that the evaluation obtained by the parent did
                                 not meet agency criteria.
                   (3) If the public agency files a due process complaint notice to request a hearing and the final decision is that the agency's
                         evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an independent educational evaluation, but not at public
                         expense.

                   (4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the public agency may ask for the parent's reason why he
                         or she objects to the public evaluation. However, the public agency may not require the parent to provide an
                         explanation and may not unreasonably delay either providing the independent educational evaluation at public
                         expense or filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation.

                   (5) A parent is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public expense each time the public agency
                         conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.
             (c)   Parent-initiated evaluations. If the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with
                   the public agency an evaluation obtained at private expense, the results of the evaluation—

                   (1) Must be considered by the public agency, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision
                         of FAPE to the child; and

                   (2) May be presented by any party as evidence at a hearing on a due process complaint under subpart E of this part
                         regarding that child.

             (d) Requests for evaluations by hearing officers. If a hearing officer requests an independent educational evaluation as part of a
                   hearing on a due process complaint, the cost of the evaluation must be at public expense.

             (e)   Agency criteria.

                   (1) If an independent educational evaluation is at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained,
                         including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that
                         the public agency uses when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with the parent's right
                         to an independent educational evaluation.

                   (2) Except for the criteria described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a public agency may not impose conditions or
                         timelines related to obtaining an independent educational evaluation at public expense.

                                 clearly not feasible to do so.

                   (2) If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the public agency must
                         take steps to ensure—

                          (i)    That the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(n))


       § 300.506 Mediation.
             (a) General. Each public agency must ensure that procedures are established and implemented to allow parties to disputes
                   involving any matter under this part, including matters arising prior to the filing of a due process complaint, to resolve
                   disputes through a mediation process.

             (b) Requirements. The procedures must meet the following requirements:

                   (1) The procedures must ensure that the mediation process—

                          (i)    Is voluntary on the part of the parties;

                          (ii)   Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a hearing on the parent's due process complaint, or to deny any
                                 other rights afforded under Part B of the Act; and

                         (iii) Is conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator who is trained in effective mediation techniques.

                   (2) A public agency may establish procedures to offer to parents and schools that choose not to use the mediation
                         process, an opportunity to meet, at a time and location convenient to the parents, with a disinterested party—

                          (i)    Who is under contract with an appropriate alternative dispute resolution entity, or a parent training and
                                 information center or community parent resource center in the State established under section 671 or 672 of the
                                 Act; and

                          (ii)   Who would explain the benefits of, and encourage the use of, the mediation process to the parents.

                   (3)

                          (i)    The State must maintain a list of individuals who are qualified mediators and knowledgeable in laws and
                                 regulations relating to the provision of special education and related services.

                          (ii)   The SEA must select mediators on a random, rotational, or other impartial basis.

                   (4) The State must bear the cost of the mediation process, including the costs of meetings described in paragraph (b)(2)
                         of this section.

                   (5) Each session in the mediation process must be scheduled in a timely manner and must be held in a location that is
                         convenient to the parties to the dispute.

                   (6) If the parties resolve a dispute through the mediation process, the parties must execute a legally binding agreement
                         that sets forth that resolution and that—

                          (i)    States that all discussions that occurred during the mediation process will remain confidential and may not be
                                 used as evidence in any subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding; and

                          (ii)   Is signed by both the parent and a representative of the agency who has the authority to bind such agency.

                   (7) A written, signed mediation agreement under this paragraph is enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction
                         or in a district court of the United States.

                   (8) Discussions that occur during the mediation process must be confidential and may not be used as evidence in any
                         subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding of any Federal court or State court of a State receiving assistance
                         under this part.
             (c)   Impartiality of mediator.

                   (1) An individual who serves as a mediator under this part—

                          (i)    May not be an employee of the SEA or the LEA that is involved in the education or care of the child; and

                          (ii)   Must not have a personal or professional interest that conflicts with the person's objectivity.

                   (2) A person who otherwise qualifies as a mediator is not an employee of an LEA or State agency described under §
                         300.228 solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a mediator.

       § 300.507 Filing a due process complaint.
             (a) General.

                         (2) (relating to the identification, evaluation or educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of
                         FAPE to the child).

                   (2) The due process complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than two years before the date the parent or
                         public agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint,
                         or, if the State has an explicit time limitation for filing a due process complaint under this part, in the time allowed by
                         that State law, except that the exceptions to the timeline described in § 300.511(f) apply to the timeline in this section.

             (b) Information for parents. The public agency must inform the parent of any free or low-cost legal and other relevant services
                   available in the area if—

                   (1) The parent requests the information; or

                   (2) The parent or the agency files a due process complaint under this section.

                   (1) The name of the child;

                   (2) The address of the residence of the child;

                   (3) The name of the school the child is attending;

                   (4) In the case of a homeless child or youth (within the meaning of section 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless
                         Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), available contact information for the child, and the name of the school the child
                         is attending;

                   (5) A description of the nature of the problem of the child relating to the proposed or refused initiation or change, including
                         facts relating to the problem; and

                   (6) A proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the party at the time.
             (c)   Notice required before a hearing on a due process complaint. A party may not have a hearing on a due process complaint
                   until the party, or the attorney representing the party, files a due process complaint that meets the requirements of
                   paragraph (b) of this section.

             (d) Sufficiency of complaint.

                   (1) The due process complaint required by this section must be deemed sufficient unless the party receiving the due
                         process complaint notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the due
                         process complaint, that the receiving party believes the due process complaint does not meet the requirements in
                         paragraph (b) of this section.

                   (2) Within five days of receipt of notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the hearing officer must make a
                         determination on the face of the due process complaint of whether the due process complaint meets the
                         requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and must immediately notify the parties in writing of that determination.

                   (3) A party may amend its due process complaint only if—

                          (i)    The other party consents in writing to the amendment and is given the opportunity to resolve the due process
                                 complaint through a meeting held pursuant to § 300.510; or

                          (ii)   The hearing officer grants permission, except that the hearing officer may only grant permission to amend at any
                                 time not later than five days before the due process hearing begins.

                   (4) If a party files an amended due process complaint, the timelines for the resolution meeting in § 300.510(a) and the
                         time period to resolve in § 300.510(b) begin again with the filing of the amended due process complaint.

             (e)   LEA response to a due process complaint.

                   (1) If the LEA has not sent a prior written notice under § 300.503 to the parent regarding the subject matter contained in
                         the parent's due process complaint, the LEA must, within 10 days of receiving the due process complaint, send to the
                         parent a response that includes—

                          (i)    An explanation of why the agency proposed or refused to take the action raised in the due process complaint;

                          (ii)   A description of other options that the IEP Team considered and the reasons why those options were rejected;

                         (iii) A description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the agency used as the basis for the
                                 proposed or refused action; and

                         (iv) A description of the other factors that are relevant to the agency's proposed or refused action.

                   (2) A response by an LEA under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be construed to preclude the LEA from asserting
                         that the parent's due process complaint was insufficient, where appropriate.

             (f)   Other party response to a due process complaint. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the party receiving a
                   due process complaint must, within 10 days of receiving the due process complaint, send to the other party a response that
                   specifically addresses the issues raised in the due process complaint.

             (a) Each SEA must develop model forms to assist parents and public agencies in filing a due process complaint in accordance
                   with §§ 300.507(a) and 300.508(a) through (c) and to assist parents and other parties in filing a State complaint under §§

             (b) Parents, public agencies, and other parties may use the appropriate model form described in paragraph (a) of this section,
                   or another form or other document, so long as the form or document that is used meets, as appropriate, the content
                   requirements in § 300.508(b) for filing a due process complaint, or the requirements in § 300.153(b) for filing a State

       § 300.510 Resolution process.
             (a) Resolution meeting.

                   (1) Within 15 days of receiving notice of the parent's due process complaint, and prior to the initiation of a due process
                         hearing under § 300.511, the LEA must convene a meeting with the parent and the relevant member or members of
                         the IEP Team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint that—

                          (i)    Includes a representative of the public agency who has decision-making authority on behalf of that agency; and

                          (ii)   May not include an attorney of the LEA unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney.

                   (2) The purpose of the meeting is for the parent of the child to discuss the due process complaint, and the facts that form
                         the basis of the due process complaint, so that the LEA has the opportunity to resolve the dispute that is the basis for
                         the due process complaint.

                   (3) The meeting described in paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section need not be held if—

                          (i)    The parent and the LEA agree in writing to waive the meeting; or

                          (ii)   The parent and the LEA agree to use the mediation process described in § 300.506.

                   (4) The parent and the LEA determine the relevant members of the IEP Team to attend the meeting.

             (b) Resolution period.

                   (1) If the LEA has not resolved the due process complaint to the satisfaction of the parent within 30 days of the receipt of
                         the due process complaint, the due process hearing may occur.

                   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the timeline for issuing a final decision under § 300.515 begins at
                         the expiration of this 30-day period.

                   (3) Except where the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation, notwithstanding
                         paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the failure of the parent filing a due process complaint to participate in the
                         resolution meeting will delay the timelines for the resolution process and due process hearing until the meeting is
                         held.

                   (4) If the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting after reasonable efforts have
                         been made (and documented using the procedures in § 300.322(d)), the LEA may, at the conclusion of the 30-day
                         period, request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process complaint.

                   (5) If the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting specified in paragraph (a) of this section within 15 days of receiving
                         notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting, the parent may seek the
                         intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing timeline.

             (c)   Adjustments to 30-day resolution period. The 45-day timeline for the due process hearing in § 300.515(a) starts the day after
                   one of the following events:

                   (1) Both parties agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting;

                   (2) After either the mediation or resolution meeting starts but before the end of the 30-day period, the parties agree in
                         writing that no agreement is possible;

                   (3) If both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of the 30-day resolution period, but later, the parent
                         or public agency withdraws from the mediation process.

       § 300.511 Impartial due process hearing.
             (a) General. Whenever a due process complaint is received under § 300.507 or § 300.532, the parents or the LEA involved in the
                   dispute must have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing, consistent with the procedures in §§ 300.507,
                   300.508, and 300.510.

             (b) Agency responsible for conducting the due process hearing. The hearing described in paragraph (a) of this section must be
                   conducted by the SEA or the public agency directly responsible for the education of the child, as determined under State
                   statute, State regulation, or a written policy of the SEA.

             (c)   Impartial hearing officer.

                   (1) At a minimum, a hearing officer—

                          (i)    Must not be—

                                 (A) An employee of the SEA or the LEA that is involved in the education or care of the child; or

                                 (B) A person having a personal or professional interest that conflicts with the person's objectivity in the hearing;

                          (ii)   Must possess knowledge of, and the ability to understand, the provisions of the Act, Federal and State regulations
                                 pertaining to the Act, and legal interpretations of the Act by Federal and State courts;

                         (iii) Must possess the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard legal
                                 practice; and

                         (iv) Must possess the knowledge and ability to render and write decisions in accordance with appropriate, standard
                                 legal practice.

                   (2) A person who otherwise qualifies to conduct a hearing under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not an employee of the
                         agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a hearing officer.

                   (3) Each public agency must keep a list of the persons who serve as hearing officers. The list must include a statement of
                         the qualifications of each of those persons.

             (d) Subject matter of due process hearings. The party requesting the due process hearing may not raise issues at the due
                   process hearing that were not raised in the due process complaint filed under § 300.508(b), unless the other party agrees
                   otherwise.

             (e)   Timeline for requesting a hearing. A parent or agency must request an impartial hearing on their due process complaint
                   within two years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis
                   of the due process complaint, or if the State has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a due process hearing under
                   this part, in the time allowed by that State law.

             (f)   Exceptions to the timeline. The timeline described in paragraph (e) of this section does not apply to a parent if the parent
                   was prevented from filing a due process complaint due to—

                   (1) Specific misrepresentations by the LEA that it had resolved the problem forming the basis of the due process
                         complaint; or

                   (2) The LEA's withholding of information from the parent that was required under this part to be provided to the parent.

       § 300.513 Hearing decisions.
             (a) Decision of hearing officer on the provision of FAPE.

                   (1) Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a hearing officer's determination of whether a child received FAPE must be
                         based on substantive grounds.

                   (2) In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing officer may find that a child did not receive a FAPE only if the
                         procedural inadequacies—

                          (i)    Impeded the child's right to a FAPE;

                          (ii)   Significantly impeded the parent's opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding the
                                 provision of a FAPE to the parent's child; or

                         (iii) Caused a deprivation of educational benefit.

                   (3) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to preclude a hearing officer from ordering an LEA to
                         comply with procedural requirements under §§ 300.500 through 300.536.

             (b) Construction clause. Nothing in §§ 300.507 through 300.513 shall be construed to affect the right of a parent to file an

                         findings and decision in the hearing may appeal to the SEA.

                   (2) If there is an appeal, the SEA must conduct an impartial review of the findings and decision appealed. The official
                         conducting the review must—

                          (i)    Examine the entire hearing record;

                         (iii) Seek additional evidence if necessary. If a hearing is held to receive additional evidence, the rights in § 300.512

                   300.534 who does not have the right to an appeal under § 300.514(b), and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision

                   process hearing under § 300.507 or §§ 300.530 through 300.532. The action may be brought in any State court of
                   competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy.

             (b) Time limitation. The party bringing the action shall have 90 days from the date of the decision of the hearing officer or, if
                   applicable, the decision of the State review official, to file a civil action, or, if the State has an explicit time limitation for
                   bringing civil actions under Part B of the Act, in the time allowed by that State law.

             (c)   Additional requirements. In any action brought under paragraph (a) of this section, the court—

                   (2) Hears additional evidence at the request of a party; and

                   (3) Basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, grants the relief that the court determines to be appropriate.

             (d) Jurisdiction of district courts. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction of actions brought under section 615
                   of the Act without regard to the amount in controversy.

             (e)   Rule of construction. Nothing in this part restricts or limits the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the
                   Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal laws
                   protecting the rights of children with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under these laws seeking relief
                   that is also available under section 615 of the Act, the procedures under §§ 300.507 and 300.514 must be exhausted to the

                          (ii)   To a prevailing party who is an SEA or LEA against the attorney of a parent who files a complaint or subsequent
                                 cause of action that is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or against the attorney of a parent who
                                 continued to litigate after the litigation clearly became frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation; or

                         (iii) To a prevailing SEA or LEA against the attorney of a parent, or against the parent, if the parent's request for a due
                                 process hearing or subsequent cause of action was presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, to
                                 cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.

                   (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect section 327 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act,

                                       of an administrative proceeding, at any time more than 10 days before the proceeding begins;

                                 (B) The offer is not accepted within 10 days; and

                                 (C) The court or administrative hearing officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more
                                       favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.

                          (ii)   Attorneys' fees may not be awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless the meeting is convened as a
                                 result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action, or at the discretion of the State, for a mediation
                                 described in § 300.506.

                         (iii) A meeting conducted pursuant to § 300.510 shall not be considered—

                                 (A) A meeting convened as a result of an administrative hearing or judicial action; or

                                 (B) An administrative hearing or judicial action for purposes of this section.

                   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an award of attorneys' fees and related costs may be made to a
                         parent who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.

                   (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the court reduces, accordingly, the amount of the attorneys' fees
                         awarded under section 615 of the Act, if the court finds that—

                          (i)    The parent, or the parent's attorney, during the course of the action or proceeding, unreasonably protracted the
                                 final resolution of the controversy;

                          (ii)   The amount of the attorneys' fees otherwise authorized to be awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate
                                 prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and
                                 experience;

                         (iii) The time spent and legal services furnished were excessive considering the nature of the action or proceeding; or

                         (iv) The attorney representing the parent did not provide to the LEA the appropriate information in the due process
                                 request notice in accordance with § 300.508.

                   (5) The provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section do not apply in any action or proceeding if the court finds that the
                         State or local agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was a violation
                         of section 615 of the Act.

       § 300.518 Child's status during proceedings.
             (a) Except as provided in § 300.533, during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process
                   complaint notice requesting a due process hearing under § 300.507, unless the State or local agency and the parents of the

             (b) If the complaint involves an application for initial admission to public school, the child, with the consent of the parents, must
                   be placed in the public school until the completion of all the proceedings.

             (c)   If the complaint involves an application for initial services under this part from a child who is transitioning from Part C of the
                   Act to Part B and is no longer eligible for Part C services because the child has turned three, the public agency is not

                   under § 300.300(b), then the public agency must provide those special education and related services that are not in
                   dispute between the parent and the public agency.
             (d) If the hearing officer in a due process hearing conducted by the SEA or a State review official in an administrative appeal
                   agrees with the child's parents that a change of placement is appropriate, that placement must be treated as an agreement
                   between the State and the parents for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.

       § 300.519 Surrogate parents.
             (a) General. Each public agency must ensure that the rights of a child are protected when—

                   (1) No parent (as defined in § 300.30) can be identified;

                   (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate a parent;

                   (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State; or

                   (4) The child is an unaccompanied homeless youth as defined in section 725(6) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless
                         Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(6)).

             (b) Duties of public agency. The duties of a public agency under paragraph (a) of this section include the assignment of an
                   individual to act as a surrogate for the parents. This must include a method—

                   (1) For determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent; and

                   (2) For assigning a surrogate parent to the child.

             (c)   Wards of the State. In the case of a child who is a ward of the State, the surrogate parent alternatively may be appointed by
                   the judge overseeing the child's case, provided that the surrogate meets the requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (e) of
                   this section.

             (d) Criteria for selection of surrogate parents.

                   (1) The public agency may select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law.

                   (2) Public agencies must ensure that a person selected as a surrogate parent—

                          (i)    Is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the child;

                          (ii)   Has no personal or professional interest that conflicts with the interest of the child the surrogate parent
                                 represents; and

                         (iii) Has knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the child.

             (e)   Non-employee requirement; compensation. A person otherwise qualified to be a surrogate parent under paragraph (d) of this
                   section is not an employee of the agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a surrogate parent.

             (f)   Unaccompanied homeless youth. In the case of a child who is an unaccompanied homeless youth, appropriate staff of
                   emergency shelters, transitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach programs may be appointed as
                   temporary surrogate parents without regard to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, until a surrogate parent can be appointed
                   that meets all of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

             (g) Surrogate parent responsibilities. The surrogate parent may represent the child in all matters relating to—

                   (1) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child; and

                   (2) The provision of FAPE to the child.

             (h) SEA responsibility. The SEA must make reasonable efforts to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30
                   days after a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.

             (a) General. A State may provide that, when a child with a disability reaches the age of majority under State law that applies to
                   all children (except for a child with a disability who has been determined to be incompetent under State law)—

                   (1)

                          (i)    The public agency must provide any notice required by this part to both the child and the parents; and

                          (ii)   All rights accorded to parents under Part B of the Act transfer to the child;

                   (2) All rights accorded to parents under Part B of the Act transfer to children who are incarcerated in an adult or juvenile,
                         State or local correctional institution; and

                   (3) Whenever a State provides for the transfer of rights under this part pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this
                         section, the agency must notify the child and the parents of the transfer of rights.

             (b) Special rule. A State must establish procedures for appointing the parent of a child with a disability, or, if the parent is not
                   available, another appropriate individual, to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the period of the
                   child's eligibility under Part B of the Act if, under State law, a child who has reached the age of majority, but has not been
                   determined to be incompetent, can be determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to the
                   child's educational program.

       § 300.530 Authority of school personnel.
             (a) Case-by-case determination. School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when
                   determining whether a change in placement, consistent with the other requirements of this section, is appropriate for a
                   child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct.

             (b) General.

                   (1) School personnel under this section may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from
                         his or her current placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension,
                         for not more than 10 consecutive school days (to the extent those alternatives are applied to children without
                         disabilities), and for additional removals of not more than 10 consecutive school days in that same school year for
                         separate incidents of misconduct (as long as those removals do not constitute a change of placement under §
                         300.536).

                   (2) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her current placement for 10 school days in the same
                         school year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency must provide services to the extent required
                         under paragraph (d) of this section.

             (c)   Additional authority. For disciplinary changes in placement that would exceed 10 consecutive school days, if the behavior
                   that gave rise to the violation of the school code is determined not to be a manifestation of the child's disability pursuant to
                   paragraph (e) of this section, school personnel may apply the relevant disciplinary procedures to children with disabilities in
                   the same manner and for the same duration as the procedures would be applied to children without disabilities, except as
                   provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

             (d) Services.

                   (1) A child with a disability who is removed from the child's current placement pursuant to paragraphs (c), or (g) of this
                         section must—

                          (i)    Continue to receive educational services, as provided in § 300.101(a), so as to enable the child to continue to
                                 participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the
                                 goals set out in the child's IEP; and

                          (ii)   Receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment, and behavioral intervention services and
                                 modifications, that are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does not recur.

                   (2) The services required by paragraph (d)(1), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (d)(5) of this section may be provided in an interim
                         alternative educational setting.

                   (3) A public agency is only required to provide services during periods of removal to a child with a disability who has been
                         removed from his or her current placement for 10 school days or less in that school year, if it provides services to a
                         child without disabilities who is similarly removed.

                   (4) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her current placement for 10 school days in the same
                         school year, if the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change of placement
                         under § 300.536, school personnel, in consultation with at least one of the child's teachers, determine the extent to
                         which services are needed, as provided in § 300.101(a), so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the
                         general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the
                         child's IEP.

                   (5) If the removal is a change of placement under § 300.536, the child's IEP Team determines appropriate services under
                         paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
             (e)   Manifestation determination.

                   (1) Within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a
                         code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the child's IEP Team (as determined by the
                         parent and the LEA) must review all relevant information in the student's file, including the child's IEP, any teacher
                         observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents to determine—

                          (i)    If the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability; or

                          (ii)   If the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP.

                   (2) The conduct must be determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability if the LEA, the parent, and relevant
                         members of the child's IEP Team determine that a condition in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this section was
                         met.

                   (3) If the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the child's IEP Team determine the condition described in paragraph
                         (e)(1)(ii) of this section was met, the LEA must take immediate steps to remedy those deficiencies.

             (f)   Determination that behavior was a manifestation. If the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team make the
                   determination that the conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability, the IEP Team must—

                   (1) Either—

                          (i)    Conduct a functional behavioral assessment, unless the LEA had conducted a functional behavioral assessment
                                 before the behavior that resulted in the change of placement occurred, and implement a behavioral intervention
                                 plan for the child; or

                          (ii)   If a behavioral intervention plan already has been developed, review the behavioral intervention plan, and modify
                                 it, as necessary, to address the behavior; and

                   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, return the child to the placement from which the child was
                         removed, unless the parent and the LEA agree to a change of placement as part of the modification of the behavioral
                         intervention plan.

             (g) Special circumstances. School personnel may remove a student to an interim alternative educational setting for not more
                   than 45 school days without regard to whether the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability, if
                   the child—

                   (1) Carries a weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school premises, or to or at a school function under the
                         jurisdiction of an SEA or an LEA;

                   (2) Knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs, or sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance, while at school, on
                         school premises, or at a school function under the jurisdiction of an SEA or an LEA; or

                   (3) Has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school, on school premises, or at a school function
                         under the jurisdiction of an SEA or an LEA.

             (h) Notification. On the date on which the decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change of placement of a child
                   with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA must notify the parents of that decision, and
                   provide the parents the procedural safeguards notice described in § 300.504.

       § 300.532 Appeal.
             (a) General. The parent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement under §§ 300.530 and
                   300.531, or the manifestation determination under § 300.530(e), or an LEA that believes that maintaining the current
                   placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others, may appeal the decision by requesting a
                   hearing. The hearing is requested by filing a complaint pursuant to §§ 300.507 and 300.508(a) and (b).

             (b) Authority of hearing officer.

                   (1) A hearing officer under § 300.511 hears, and makes a determination regarding an appeal under paragraph (a) of this
                         section.

                   (2) In making the determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hearing officer may—

                          (i)    Return the child with a disability to the placement from which the child was removed if the hearing officer
                                 determines that the removal was a violation of § 300.530 or that the child's behavior was a manifestation of the
                                 child's disability; or

                          (ii)   Order a change of placement of the child with a disability to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting
                                 for not more than 45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of the
                                 child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.

                   (3) The procedures under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be repeated, if the LEA believes that
                         returning the child to the original placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.

             (c)   Expedited due process hearing.

                   (1) Whenever a hearing is requested under paragraph (a) of this section, the parents or the LEA involved in the dispute
                         must have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing consistent with the requirements of §§ 300.507 and
                         300.508(a) through (c) and §§ 300.510 through 300.514, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) through (4) of this
                         section.

                   (2) The SEA or LEA is responsible for arranging the expedited due process hearing, which must occur within 20 school
                         days of the date the complaint requesting the hearing is filed. The hearing officer must make a determination within 10
                         school days after the hearing.

                   (3) Unless the parents and LEA agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this
                         section, or agree to use the mediation process described in § 300.506—

                          (i)    A resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving notice of the due process complaint; and

                          (ii)   The due process hearing may proceed unless the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties
                                 within 15 days of the receipt of the due process complaint.

                   (4) A State may establish different State-imposed procedural rules for expedited due process hearings conducted under
                         this section than it has established for other due process hearings, but, except for the timelines as modified in
                         paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the State must ensure that the requirements in §§ 300.510 through 300.514 are met.

                   (5) The decisions on expedited due process hearings are appealable consistent with § 300.514.

       § 300.533 Placement during appeals.
       When an appeal under § 300.532 has been made by either the parent or the LEA, the child must remain in the interim alternative
       educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period specified in § 300.530(c) or
       (g), whichever occurs first, unless the parent and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.

       § 300.534 Protections for children not determined eligible for special education and related services.
             (a) General. A child who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and related services under this part and
                   who has engaged in behavior that violated a code of student conduct, may assert any of the protections provided for in this
                   part if the public agency had knowledge (as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section) that the child was
                   a child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred.

             (b) Basis of knowledge. A public agency must be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if before the
                   behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred—

                   (1) The parent of the child expressed concern in writing to supervisory or administrative personnel of the appropriate
                         educational agency, or a teacher of the child, that the child is in need of special education and related services;

                   (2) The parent of the child requested an evaluation of the child pursuant to §§ 300.300 through 300.311; or

                   (3) The teacher of the child, or other personnel of the LEA, expressed specific concerns about a pattern of behavior
                         demonstrated by the child directly to the director of special education of the agency or to other supervisory personnel
                         of the agency.

             (c)   Exception. A public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge under paragraph (b) of this section if—

                   (1) The parent of the child—

                          (i)    Has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to §§ 300.300 through 300.311; or

                          (ii)   Has refused services under this part; or

                   (2) The child has been evaluated in accordance with §§ 300.300 through 300.311 and determined to not be a child with a
                         disability under this part.

             (d) Conditions that apply if no basis of knowledge.

                   (1) If a public agency does not have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability (in accordance with paragraphs (b)
                         and (c) of this section) prior to taking disciplinary measures against the child, the child may be subjected to the
                         disciplinary measures applied to children without disabilities who engage in comparable behaviors consistent with
                         paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

                   (2)

                          (i)    If a request is made for an evaluation of a child during the time period in which the child is subjected to
                                 disciplinary measures under § 300.530, the evaluation must be conducted in an expedited manner.

                          (ii)   Until the evaluation is completed, the child remains in the educational placement determined by school
                                 authorities, which can include suspension or expulsion without educational services.

                         (iii) If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, taking into consideration information from the evaluation
                                 conducted by the agency and information provided by the parents, the agency must provide special education
                                 and related services in accordance with this part, including the requirements of §§ 300.530 through 300.536 and

       § 300.535 Referral to and action by law enforcement and judicial authorities.
             (a) Rule of construction. Nothing in this part prohibits an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability to
                   appropriate authorities or prevents State law enforcement and judicial authorities from exercising their responsibilities with
                   regard to the application of Federal and State law to crimes committed by a child with a disability.

             (b) Transmittal of records.

                   (1) An agency reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability must ensure that copies of the special education
                         and disciplinary records of the child are transmitted for consideration by the appropriate authorities to whom the
                         agency reports the crime.

                   (2) An agency reporting a crime under this section may transmit copies of the child's special education and disciplinary
                         records only to the extent that the transmission is permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(k)(6))


       § 300.536 Change of placement because of disciplinary removals.
             (a) For purposes of removals of a child with a disability from the child's current educational placement under §§ 300.530
                   through 300.535, a change of placement occurs if—

                   (1) The removal is for more than 10 consecutive school days; or

                   (2) The child has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern—

                          (i)    Because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year;

                          (ii)   Because the child's behavior is substantially similar to the child's behavior in previous incidents that resulted in
                                 the series of removals; and

                         (iii) Because of such additional factors as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been
                                 removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another.

             (b)

                   (1) The public agency determines on a case-by-case basis whether a pattern of removals constitutes a change of
                         placement.

                   (2) This determination is subject to review through due process and judicial proceedings.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(k))


       § 300.537 State enforcement mechanisms.
       Notwithstanding §§ 300.506(b)(7) and 300.510(d)(2), which provide for judicial enforcement of a written agreement reached as a
       result of mediation or a resolution meeting, there is nothing in this part that would prevent the SEA from using other mechanisms to
       seek enforcement of that agreement, provided that use of those mechanisms is not mandatory and does not delay or deny a party the
       right to seek enforcement of the written agreement in a State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.

             (b) The primary focus of the State's monitoring activities must be on—

                   (1) Improving educational results and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities; and

                   (2) Ensuring that public agencies meet the program requirements under Part B of the Act, with a particular emphasis on
                         those requirements that are most closely related to improving educational results for children with disabilities.

             (c)   As a part of its responsibilities under paragraph (a) of this section, the State must use quantifiable indicators and such
                   qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance in the priority areas identified in paragraph (d) of
                   this section, and the indicators established by the Secretary for the State performance plans.

             (d) The State must monitor the LEAs located in the State, using quantifiable indicators in each of the following priority areas,
                   and using such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance in those areas:

                   (1) Provision of FAPE in the least restrictive environment.

                   (2) State exercise of general supervision, including child find, effective monitoring, the use of resolution meetings,
                         mediation, and a system of transition services as defined in § 300.43 and in 20 U.S.C. 1437(a)(9).

                   (3) Disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services, to the extent the
                         representation is the result of inappropriate identification.

             (e)   In exercising its monitoring responsibilities under paragraph (d) of this section, the State must ensure that when it identifies
                   noncompliance with the requirements of this part by LEAs, the noncompliance is corrected as soon as possible, and in no
                   case later than one year after the State's identification of the noncompliance.

                                      State's performance plan as soon as practicable but no later than 120 days following the State's submission
                                      of its annual performance report to the Secretary under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

                                 (B) Make each of the following items available through public means: the State's performance plan, under §

                                      reports on the performance of each LEA located in the State, under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section. In
                                      doing so, the State must, at a minimum, post the plan and reports on the SEA's Web site, and distribute the
                                      plan and reports to the media and through public agencies.

                          (ii)   If the State, in meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, collects performance data through

                   (2) State performance report. The State must report annually to the Secretary on the performance of the State under the
                         State's performance plan.

                   (3) Privacy. The State must not report to the public or the Secretary any information on performance that would result in
                         the disclosure of personally identifiable information about individual children, or where the available data are
                         insufficient to yield statistically reliable information.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1416(d))


       § 300.604 Enforcement.
             (a) Needs assistance. If the Secretary determines, for two consecutive years, that a State needs assistance under § 300.603(b)

                   (1) Advises the State of available sources of technical assistance that may help the State address the areas in which the
                         State needs assistance, which may include assistance from the Office of Special Education Programs, other offices of
                         the Department of Education, other Federal agencies, technical assistance providers approved by the Secretary, and
                         other federally funded nonprofit agencies, and requires the State to work with appropriate entities. Such technical
                         assistance may include—

                          (i)    The provision of advice by experts to address the areas in which the State needs assistance, including explicit
                                 plans for addressing the area for concern within a specified period of time;

                          (ii)   Assistance in identifying and implementing professional development, instructional strategies, and methods of
                                 instruction that are based on scientifically based research;

                         (iii) Designating and using distinguished superintendents, principals, special education administrators, special
                                 education teachers, and other teachers to provide advice, technical assistance, and support; and

                         (iv) Devising additional approaches to providing technical assistance, such as collaborating with institutions of higher
                                 education, educational service agencies, national centers of technical assistance supported under Part D of the
                                 Act, and private providers of scientifically based technical assistance.

                   (2) Directs the use of State-level funds under section 611(e) of the Act on the area or areas in which the State needs
                         assistance.

                   (3) Identifies the State as a high-risk grantee and imposes special conditions on the State's grant under Part B of the Act.

             (b) Needs intervention. If the Secretary determines, for three or more consecutive years, that a State needs intervention under §
                   300.603(b)(1)(iii) in implementing the requirements of Part B of the Act, the following shall apply:

                   (1) The Secretary may take any of the actions described in paragraph (a) of this section.

                   (2) The Secretary takes one or more of the following actions:

                          (i)    Requires the State to prepare a corrective action plan or improvement plan if the Secretary determines that the
                                 State should be able to correct the problem within one year.

                          (ii)   Requires the State to enter into a compliance agreement under section 457 of the General Education Provisions
                                 Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1221 et seq. (GEPA), if the Secretary has reason to believe that the State cannot
                                 correct the problem within one year.

                         (iii) For each year of the determination, withholds not less than 20 percent and not more than 50 percent of the
                                 State's funds under section 611(e) of the Act, until the Secretary determines the State has sufficiently addressed
                                 the areas in which the State needs intervention.

                         (iv) Seeks to recover funds under section 452 of GEPA.

                          (v)    Withholds, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under Part B of the Act.

                         (vi) Refers the matter for appropriate enforcement action, which may include referral to the Department of Justice.

             (c)   Needs substantial intervention. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, at any time that the Secretary
                   determines that a State needs substantial intervention in implementing the requirements of Part B of the Act or that there is
                   a substantial failure to comply with any condition of an SEA's or LEA's eligibility under Part B of the Act, the Secretary takes
                   one or more of the following actions:

                   (1) Recovers funds under section 452 of GEPA.

                   (2) Withholds, in whole or in part, any further payments to the State under Part B of the Act.

                   (3) Refers the case to the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Education.

                   (4) Refers the matter for appropriate enforcement action, which may include referral to the Department of Justice.
             (d) Report to Congress. The Secretary reports to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of
                   Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate within 30 days of taking
                   enforcement action pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, on the specific action taken and the reasons why
                   enforcement action was taken.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1416(e)(1)-(e)(3), (e)(5))


       § 300.605 Withholding funds.
             (a) Opportunity for hearing. Prior to withholding any funds under Part B of the Act, the Secretary provides reasonable notice and
                   an opportunity for a hearing to the SEA involved, pursuant to the procedures in §§ 300.180 through 300.183.

             (b) Suspension. Pending the outcome of any hearing to withhold payments under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary
                   may suspend payments to a recipient, suspend the authority of the recipient to obligate funds under Part B of the Act, or
                   both, after the recipient has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause why future payments or
                   authority to obligate funds under Part B of the Act should not be suspended.

             (c)   Nature of withholding.

                   (1) If the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to withhold further payments under § 300.604(b)(2) or (c)(2), the
                         Secretary may determine—

                          (i)    That the withholding will be limited to programs or projects, or portions of programs or projects, that affected the
                                 Secretary's determination under § 300.603(b)(1); or

                          (ii)   That the SEA must not make further payments under Part B of the Act to specified State agencies or LEAs that
                                 caused or were involved in the Secretary's determination under § 300.603(b)(1).

                   (2) Until the Secretary is satisfied that the condition that caused the initial withholding has been substantially rectified—

                          (i)    Payments to the State under Part B of the Act must be withheld in whole or in part; and

                          (ii)   Payments by the SEA under Part B of the Act must be limited to State agencies and LEAs whose actions did not
                                 cause or were not involved in the Secretary's determination under § 300.603(b)(1), as the case may be.

       § 300.606 Public attention.
       Whenever a State receives notice that the Secretary is proposing to take or is taking an enforcement action pursuant to § 300.604, the
       State must, by means of a public notice, take such actions as may be necessary to notify the public within the State of the pendency
       of an action pursuant to § 300.604, including, at a minimum, by posting the notice on the SEA's Web site and distributing the notice to
       the media and through public agencies.

       For purposes of this subpart, if responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of Part B of the Act are met with respect to children
       with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other
       than the SEA pursuant to § 300.149(d), and if the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of Part B
       of the Act are related to a failure by the public agency, the Secretary takes appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with
       Part B of the Act, except that—


             (a) Any reduction or withholding of payments to the State under § 300.604 must be proportionate to the total funds allotted
                   under section 611 of the Act to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the
                   supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State

                   fiscal year.

             (a) Each participating agency must permit parents to inspect and review any education records relating to their children that
                   are collected, maintained, or used by the agency under this part. The agency must comply with a request without
                   unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IEP, or any hearing pursuant to § 300.507 or §§ 300.530 through
                   300.532, or resolution session pursuant to § 300.510, and in no case more than 45 days after the request has been made.

             (b) The right to inspect and review education records under this section includes—

                   (1) The right to a response from the participating agency to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of
                         the records;

                   (2) The right to request that the agency provide copies of the records containing the information if failure to provide those
                         copies would effectively prevent the parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the records; and

                   (3) The right to have a representative of the parent inspect and review the records.

             (c)   An agency may presume that the parent has authority to inspect and review records relating to his or her child unless the

                                 levels; and policies, practices, or procedures that contribute to the significant disproportionality.

                         (iii) Must address a policy, practice, or procedure it identifies as contributing to the significant disproportionality,
                                 including a policy, practice or procedure that results in a failure to identify, or the inappropriate identification of, a
                                 racial or ethnic group (or groups).

                   (2) An LEA may use funds reserved for comprehensive coordinated early intervening services to serve children from age 3
                         through grade 12, particularly, but not exclusively, children in those groups that were significantly overidentified under
                         paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, including—

                          (i)    Children who are not currently identified as needing special education or related services but who need additional
                                 academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment; and

                          (ii)   Children with disabilities.

                   (3) An LEA may not limit the provision of comprehensive coordinated early intervening services under this paragraph to
                         children with disabilities.

             (e)   Exception to comprehensive coordinated early intervening services. The State or the Secretary of the Interior shall not require
                   any LEA that serves only children with disabilities identified under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to reserve funds to
                   provide comprehensive coordinated early intervening services.

             (f)   Rule of construction. Nothing in this section authorizes a State or an LEA to develop or implement policies, practices, or
                   procedures that result in actions that violate the requirements of this part, including requirements related to child find and
                   ensuring that a free appropriate public education is available to all eligible children with disabilities.

       § 300.647 Determining significant disproportionality.
             (a) Definitions.

                   (1) Alternate risk ratio is a calculation performed by dividing the risk of a particular outcome for children in one racial or
                         ethnic group within an LEA by the risk of that outcome for children in all other racial or ethnic groups in the State.

                   (2) Comparison group consists of the children in all other racial or ethnic groups within an LEA or within the State, when
                         reviewing a particular racial or ethnic group within an LEA for significant disproportionality.

                   (3) Minimum cell size is the minimum number of children experiencing a particular outcome, to be used as the numerator
                         when calculating either the risk for a particular racial or ethnic group or the risk for children in all other racial or ethnic
                         groups.

                   (4) Minimum n-size is the minimum number of children enrolled in an LEA with respect to identification, and the minimum
                         number of children with disabilities enrolled in an LEA with respect to placement and discipline, to be used as the
                         denominator when calculating either the risk for a particular racial or ethnic group or the risk for children in all other
                         racial or ethnic groups.

5/20/25, 6:09 PM                                       eCFR :: 34 CFR Part 300 -- Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities
                   (5) Risk is the likelihood of a particular outcome (identification, placement, or disciplinary removal) for a specified racial or
                         ethnic group (or groups), calculated by dividing the number of children from a specified racial or ethnic group (or
                         groups) experiencing that outcome by the total number of children from that racial or ethnic group or groups enrolled
                         in the LEA.

                   (6) Risk ratio is a calculation performed by dividing the risk of a particular outcome for children in one racial or ethnic
                         group within an LEA by the risk for children in all other racial and ethnic groups within the LEA.

                   (7) Risk ratio threshold is a threshold, determined by the State, over which disproportionality based on race or ethnicity is
                         significant under § 300.646(a) and (b).
             (b) Significant disproportionality determinations. In determining whether significant disproportionality exists in a State or LEA
                   under § 300.646(a) and (b)—

                   (1)

                          (i)    The State must set a:

                                 (A) Reasonable risk ratio threshold;

                                 (B) Reasonable minimum cell size;

                                 (C) Reasonable minimum n-size; and

                                 (D) Standard for measuring reasonable progress if a State uses the flexibility described in paragraph (d)(2) of
                                      this section.

                          (ii)   The State may, but is not required to, set the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section at different
                                 levels for each of the categories described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.

                         (iii) The standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section:

                                 (A) Must be based on advice from stakeholders, including State Advisory Panels, as provided under section
                                      612(a)(21)(D)(iii) of the Act; and

                                 (B) Are subject to monitoring and enforcement for reasonableness by the Secretary consistent with section 616
                                      of the Act.

                         (iv) When monitoring for reasonableness under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the Department finds that the
                                 following are presumptively reasonable:

                                 (A) A minimum cell size under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section no greater than 10; and

                                 (B) A minimum n-size under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section no greater than 30.

                   (2) The State must apply the risk ratio threshold or thresholds determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to risk ratios
                         or alternate risk ratios, as appropriate, in each category described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section and the
                         following racial and ethnic groups:

                          (i)    Hispanic/Latino of any race; and, for individuals who are non-Hispanic/Latino only;

                          (ii)   American Indian or Alaska Native;

                         (iii) Asian;

                         (iv) Black or African American;

                          (v)    Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;

                         (vi) White; and

                         (vii) Two or more races.

                   (3) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c) of this section, the State must calculate the risk ratio for each LEA, for
                         each racial and ethnic group in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to:

                          (i)    The identification of children ages 3 through 21 as children with disabilities; and

                          (ii)   The identification of children ages 3 through 21 as children with the following impairments:

                                 (A) Intellectual disabilities;

                                 (B) Specific learning disabilities;

                                 (C) Emotional disturbance;

                                 (D) Speech or language impairments;

                   (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c) of this section, the State must calculate the risk ratio for each LEA, for
                         each racial and ethnic group in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to the following placements into particular
                         educational settings, including disciplinary removals:

                          (i)    For children with disabilities ages 6 through 21, inside a regular class less than 40 percent of the day;

                          (ii)   For children with disabilities ages 6 through 21, inside separate schools and residential facilities, not including
                                 homebound or hospital settings, correctional facilities, or private schools;

                         (iii) For children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, out-of-school suspensions and expulsions of 10 days or fewer;

                         (iv) For children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, out-of-school suspensions and expulsions of more than 10 days;

                          (v)    For children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, in-school suspensions of 10 days or fewer;

                         (vi) For children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, in-school suspensions of more than 10 days; and

                         (vii) For children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, disciplinary removals in total, including in-school and out-of-
                                 school suspensions, expulsions, removals by school personnel to an interim alternative education setting, and
                                 removals by a hearing officer.

                   (5) The State must calculate an alternate risk ratio with respect to the categories described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of
                         this section if the comparison group in the LEA does not meet the minimum cell size or the minimum n-size.

                   (6) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the State must identify as having significant disproportionality
                         based on race or ethnicity under § 300.646(a) and (b) any LEA that has a risk ratio or alternate risk ratio for any racial
                         or ethnic group in any of the categories described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section that exceeds the risk
                         ratio threshold set by the State for that category.

                   (7) The State must report all risk ratio thresholds, minimum cell sizes, minimum n-sizes, and standards for measuring
                         reasonable progress selected under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this section, and the rationales for each, to
                         the Department at a time and in a manner determined by the Secretary. Rationales for minimum cell sizes and
                         minimum n-sizes not presumptively reasonable under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section must include a detailed
                         explanation of why the numbers chosen are reasonable and how they ensure that the State is appropriately analyzing
                         and identifying LEAs with significant disparities, based on race and ethnicity, in the identification, placement, or
                         discipline of children with disabilities.
             (c)   Exception. A State is not required to calculate a risk ratio or alternate risk ratio, as outlined in paragraphs (b)(3), (4), and (5)
                   of this section, to determine significant disproportionality if:

                   (1) The particular racial or ethnic group being analyzed does not meet the minimum cell size or minimum n-size; or

                   (2) In calculating the alternate risk ratio under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the comparison group in the State does not
                         meet the minimum cell size or minimum n-size.

             (d) Flexibility. A State is not required to identify an LEA as having significant disproportionality based on race or ethnicity under
                   § 300.646(a) and (b) until—

                   (1) The LEA has exceeded a risk ratio threshold set by the State for a racial or ethnic group in a category described in
                         paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section for up to three prior consecutive years preceding the identification; and

                   (2) The LEA has exceeded the risk ratio threshold and has failed to demonstrate reasonable progress, as determined by
                         the State, in lowering the risk ratio or alternate risk ratio for the group and category in each of the two prior
                         consecutive years.

                                 (A) Eighty-five (85) percent of the State's population of children aged 3 through 21 who are of the same age as
                                      children with disabilities for whom the State ensures the availability of FAPE under Part B of the Act; and

                                 (B) Fifteen (15) percent of the State's population of children described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section
                                      who are living in poverty.

                   (1) Funds reserved. From the amount appropriated for any fiscal year under section 611(i) of the Act, the Secretary
                         reserves not more than one percent, which must be used—

                          (i)    To provide assistance to the outlying areas in accordance with their respective populations of individuals aged 3
                                 through 21; and

                          (ii)   To provide each freely associated State a grant in the amount that the freely associated State received for fiscal
                                 year 2003 under Part B of the Act, but only if the freely associated State—

                                 (A) Meets the applicable requirements of Part B of the Act that apply to States.

                                 (B) Meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

                   (2) Application. Any freely associated State that wishes to receive funds under Part B of the Act must include, in its

                                 to make FAPE available to all children with disabilities;

                         (iii) The identity of the source and amount of funds, in addition to funds under Part B of the Act, that it will make
                                 available to ensure that FAPE is available to all children with disabilities within its jurisdiction; and

                         (iv) Such other information and assurances as the Secretary may require.
                   (3) Special rule. The provisions of Public Law 95-134, permitting the consolidation of grants by the outlying areas, do not
                         apply to funds provided to the outlying areas or to the freely associated States under Part B of the Act.
             (b) Secretary of the Interior. From the amount appropriated for any fiscal year under section 611(i) of the Act, the Secretary
                   reserves 1.226 percent to provide assistance to the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with §§ 300.707 through
                   300.716.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(b))



       § 300.702 Technical assistance.
             (a) In general. The Secretary may reserve not more than one-half of one percent of the amounts appropriated under Part B of
                   the Act for each fiscal year to support technical assistance activities authorized under section 616(i) of the Act.

             (b) Maximum amount. The maximum amount the Secretary may reserve under paragraph (a) of this section for any fiscal year
                   is $25,000,000, cumulatively adjusted by the rate of inflation as measured by the percentage increase, if any, from the
                   preceding fiscal year in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
                   the Department of Labor.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(c))


       § 300.703 Allocations to States.
             (a) General. After reserving funds for technical assistance under § 300.702, and for payments to the outlying areas, the freely
                   associated States, and the Secretary of the Interior under § 300.701 (a) and (b) for a fiscal year, the Secretary allocates the
                   remaining amount among the States in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

             (b) Special rule for use of fiscal year 1999 amount. If a State received any funds under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999
                   on the basis of children aged three through five, but does not make FAPE available to all children with disabilities aged three
                   through five in the State in any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary computes the State's amount for fiscal year 1999,
                   solely for the purpose of calculating the State's allocation in that subsequent year under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section,
                   by subtracting the amount allocated to the State for fiscal year 1999 on the basis of those children.

             (c)   Increase in funds. If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is
                   equal to or greater than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those
                   allocations are calculated as follows:

                   (1) Allocation of increase —

                          (i)    General. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary allocates for the fiscal year—

                                 (A) To each State the amount the State received under this section for fiscal year 1999;

                                 (B) Eighty-five (85) percent of any remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of
                                      children aged 3 through 21 who are of the same age as children with disabilities for whom the State ensures
                                      the availability of FAPE under Part B of the Act; and

                                 (C) Fifteen (15) percent of those remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of
                                      children described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section who are living in poverty.

                          (ii)   Data. For the purpose of making grants under this section, the Secretary uses the most recent population data,
                                 including data on children living in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the Secretary.

                   (2) Limitations. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, allocations under this section are subject to the
                         following:

                          (i)    Preceding year allocation. No State's allocation may be less than its allocation under section 611 of the Act for the
                                 preceding fiscal year.

                          (ii)   Minimum. No State's allocation may be less than the greatest of—

                                 (A) The sum of—

                                      (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999; and

                                      (2) One third of one percent of the amount by which the amount appropriated under section 611(i) of the
                                             Act for the fiscal year exceeds the amount appropriated for section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999;

                                 (B) The sum of—

                                      (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                                      (2) That amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase in the funds appropriated for section
                                             611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or

                                 (C) The sum of—

                                      (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                                      (2) That amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase in the amount appropriated for
                                             section 611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year.

                         (iii) Maximum. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, no State's allocation under paragraph (a) of this
                                 section may exceed the sum of—

                                 (A) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                                 (B) That amount multiplied by the sum of 1.5 percent and the percentage increase in the amount appropriated
                                      under section 611 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year.
                   (3) Ratable reduction. If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (c) of this section is insufficient to
                         pay those allocations in full, those allocations are ratably reduced, subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
             (d) Decrease in funds. If the amount available for allocations to States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is
                   less than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are
                   calculated as follows:

                   (1) Amounts greater than fiscal year 1999 allocations. If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (a) of this
                         section is greater than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1999, each State is allocated the sum of—

                          (i)    1999 amount. The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999; and

                          (ii)   Remaining funds. An amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as the increase the State
                                 received under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year over fiscal year 1999 bears to the total of all
                                 such increases for all States.

                   (2) Amounts equal to or less than fiscal year 1999 allocations —

                          (i)    General. If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (a) of this section is equal to or less than the
                                 amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1999, each State is allocated the amount it received for fiscal year
                                 1999.

                          (ii)   Ratable reduction. If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (d) of this section is insufficient to
                                 make the allocations described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, those allocations are ratably reduced.

                          (i)    Each State may reserve for each fiscal year not more than the maximum amount the State was eligible to reserve
                                 for State administration under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 2004 or $800,000 (adjusted in accordance
                                 with paragraph (a)(2) of this section), whichever is greater; and

                                 1111(d) of the ESEA on the basis of consistent underperformance of the disaggregated subgroup of children with
                                 disabilities, including providing professional development to special and regular education teachers who teach
                                 children with disabilities, based on scientifically based research to improve educational instruction, in order to

                   (1) In general—

                          (i)    For the purpose of assisting LEAs (including a charter school that is an LEA or a consortium of LEAs) in
                                 addressing the needs of high need children with disabilities, each State has the option to reserve for each fiscal
                                 year 10 percent of the amount of funds the State reserves for other State-level activities under paragraph (b)(1)
                                 of this section—

                                 (A) To finance and make disbursements from the high cost fund to LEAs in accordance with paragraph (c) of
                                      this section during the first and succeeding fiscal years of the high cost fund; and

                                 (B) To support innovative and effective ways of cost sharing by the State, by an LEA, or among a consortium of
                                      LEAs, as determined by the State in coordination with representatives from LEAs, subject to paragraph (c)
                                      (2)(ii) of this section.

                          (ii)   For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, local educational agency includes a charter school that is an LEA, or
                                 a consortium of LEAs.

                   (2)

                          (i)    A State must not use any of the funds the State reserves pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, which are
                                 solely for disbursement to LEAs, for costs associated with establishing, supporting, and otherwise administering
                                 the fund. The State may use funds the State reserves under paragraph (a) of this section for those administrative
                                 costs.

                          (ii)   A State must not use more than 5 percent of the funds the State reserves pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this
                                 section for each fiscal year to support innovative and effective ways of cost sharing among consortia of LEAs.

                   (3)

                          (i)    The SEA must develop, not later than 90 days after the State reserves funds under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this
                                 section, annually review, and amend as necessary, a State plan for the high cost fund. Such State plan must—

                                 (A) Establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives from LEAs, a definition of a high need child
                                      with a disability that, at a minimum—

                                      (1) Addresses the financial impact a high need child with a disability has on the budget of the child's LEA;
                                             and

                                      (2) Ensures that the cost of the high need child with a disability is greater than 3 times the average per
                                             pupil expenditure (as defined in section 8101 of the ESEA) in that State;

                                 (B) Establish eligibility criteria for the participation of an LEA that, at a minimum, take into account the number
                                      and percentage of high need children with disabilities served by an LEA;

                                 (C) Establish criteria to ensure that placements supported by the fund are consistent with the requirements of
                                      §§ 300.114 through 300.118;

                                 (D) Develop a funding mechanism that provides distributions each fiscal year to LEAs that meet the criteria
                                      developed by the State under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section;

                                 (E) Establish an annual schedule by which the SEA must make its distributions from the high cost fund each
                                      fiscal year; and

                                 (F) If the State elects to reserve funds for supporting innovative and effective ways of cost sharing under
                                      paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, describe how these funds will be used.

                          (ii)   The State must make its final State plan available to the public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the
                                 school year, including dissemination of such information on the State Web site.

                   (4)

                          (i)    Each SEA must make all annual disbursements from the high cost fund established under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of
                                 this section in accordance with the State plan published pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

                          (ii)   The costs associated with educating a high need child with a disability, as defined under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of
                                 this section, are only those costs associated with providing direct special education and related services to the
                                 child that are identified in that child's IEP, including the cost of room and board for a residential placement
                                 determined necessary, consistent with § 300.114, to implement a child's IEP.

                         (iii) The funds in the high cost fund remain under the control of the State until disbursed to an LEA to support a
                                 specific child who qualifies under the State plan for the high cost funds or distributed to LEAs, consistent with
                                 paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

                   (5) The disbursements under paragraph (c)(4) of this section must not be used to support legal fees, court costs, or other
                         costs associated with a cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure FAPE for such child.

                   (6) Nothing in paragraph (c) of this section—

                          (i)    Limits or conditions the right of a child with a disability who is assisted under Part B of the Act to receive FAPE
                                 pursuant to section 612(a)(1) of the Act in the least restrictive environment pursuant to section 612(a)(5) of the
                                 Act; or

                          (ii)   Authorizes an SEA or LEA to establish a limit on what may be spent on the education of a child with a disability.

                   (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section, a State may use funds reserved
                         pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for implementing a placement neutral cost sharing and reimbursement
                         program of high need, low incidence, catastrophic, or extraordinary aid to LEAs that provides services to high need
                         children based on eligibility criteria for such programs that were created not later than January 1, 2004, and are
                         currently in operation, if such program serves children that meet the requirement of the definition of a high need child
                         with a disability as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.

                   (8) Disbursements provided under paragraph (c) of this section must not be used to pay costs that otherwise would be
                         reimbursed as medical assistance for a child with a disability under the State Medicaid program under Title XIX of the
                         Social Security Act.

                   (9) Funds reserved under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section from the appropriation for any fiscal year, but not expended
                         pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section before the beginning of their last year of availability for obligation, must be
                         allocated to LEAs in the same manner as other funds from the appropriation for that fiscal year are allocated to LEAs
                         under § 300.705 during their final year of availability.
             (d) Inapplicability of certain prohibitions. A State may use funds the State reserves under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section
                   without regard to—

                   (1) The prohibition on commingling of funds in § 300.162(b).

                   (2) The prohibition on supplanting other funds in § 300.162(c).

             (e)   Special rule for increasing funds. A State may use funds the State reserves under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as a result
                   of inflationary increases under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to carry out activities authorized under paragraph (b)(4)(i),
                   (iii), (vii), or (viii) of this section.

             (f)   Flexibility in using funds for Part C. Any State eligible to receive a grant under section 619 of the Act may use funds made
                   available under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, § 300.705(c), or § 300.814(e) to develop and implement a State policy
                   jointly with the lead agency under Part C of the Act and the SEA to provide early intervention services (which must include
                   an educational component that promotes school readiness and incorporates preliteracy, language, and numeracy skills) in
                   accordance with Part C of the Act to children with disabilities who are eligible for services under section 619 of the Act and
                   who previously received services under Part C of the Act until the children enter, or are eligible under State law to enter,
                   kindergarten, or elementary school as appropriate.

       § 300.705 Subgrants to LEAs.
             (a) Subgrants required. Each State that receives a grant under section 611 of the Act for any fiscal year must distribute any
                   funds the State does not reserve under § 300.704 to LEAs (including public charter schools that operate as LEAs) in the
                   State that have established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act for use in accordance with Part B of the Act.
                   Effective with funds that become available on the July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to eligible LEAs, including
                   public charter schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any children with disabilities.

             (b) Allocations to LEAs. For each fiscal year for which funds are allocated to States under § 300.703, each State shall allocate
                   funds as follows:

                   (1) Base payments. The State first must award each LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section the amount the LEA
                         would have received under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999, if the State had distributed 75 percent of its
                         grant for that year under section 611(d) of the Act, as that section was then in effect.

                   (2) Base payment adjustments. For any fiscal year after 1999—

                          (i)    If a new LEA is created, the State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this
                                 section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by
                                 the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities
                                 ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under § 300.703(b), currently
                                 provided special education by each of the LEAs;

                          (ii)   If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the State must combine the base allocations of the
                                 merged LEAs;

                         (iii) If, for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative responsibility for providing services to children
                                 with disabilities ages 3 through 21 change, the base allocations of affected LEAs must be redistributed among
                                 affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21
                                 if a State has had its payment reduced under § 300.703(b), currently provided special education by each affected
                                 LEA; and

                         (iv) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for
                                 the first fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it is serving any children with
                                 disabilities. The State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the

                                 LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the LEA, among
                                 the LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages
                                 6 through 21 currently provided special education by each of the LEAs. This requirement takes effect with funds
                                 that become available on July 1, 2009.
                   (3) Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as adjusted by
                         paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must—

                          (i)    Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of the relative numbers of children
                                 enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; and

                          (ii)   Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in accordance with their relative numbers of children
                                 living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.
             (c)   Reallocation of LEA funds.

                   (1) If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities residing in the area
                         served by that agency with State and local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under this part that
                         are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special
                         education and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The
                         SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum
                         amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.704.

                   (2) After an SEA distributes funds under this part to an eligible LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, as
                         provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of time prior to the end
                         of the carryover period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may reallocate any of
                         those funds not obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately providing special education
                         and related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also
                         retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it
                         is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.704.

       § 300.804 Eligibility.
       A State is eligible for a grant under section 619 of the Act if the State—


             (a) Is eligible under section 612 of the Act to receive a grant under Part B of the Act; and

             (b) Makes FAPE available to all children with disabilities, aged three through five, residing in the State.

       § 300.806 Eligibility for financial assistance.
       No State or LEA, or other public institution or agency, may receive a grant or enter into a contract or cooperative agreement under
       subpart 2 or 3 of Part D of the Act that relates exclusively to programs, projects, and activities pertaining to children aged three
       through five years, unless the State is eligible to receive a grant under section 619(b) of the Act.


       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1481(e))


       § 300.807 Allocations to States.
       The Secretary allocates the amount made available to carry out section 619 of the Act for a fiscal year among the States in
       accordance with §§ 300.808 through 300.810.


       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(c)(1))



       § 300.808 Increase in funds.
       If the amount available for allocation to States under § 300.807 for a fiscal year is equal to or greater than the amount allocated to the
       States under section 619 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as follows:


             (a) Except as provided in § 300.809, the Secretary—

                   (1) Allocates to each State the amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997;

                   (2) Allocates 85 percent of any remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of children aged
                         three through five; and

                   (3) Allocates 15 percent of those remaining funds to States on the basis of the States' relative populations of all children
                         aged three through five who are living in poverty.

             (b) For the purpose of making grants under this section, the Secretary uses the most recent population data, including data on
                   children living in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the Secretary.

                   (2) No State's allocation may be less than the greatest of—

                          (i)   The sum of—

                                (A) The amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997; and

                                (B) One-third of one percent of the amount by which the amount appropriated under section 619(j) of the Act for
                                      the fiscal year exceeds the amount appropriated for section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997;

                          (ii)   The sum of—

                                 (A) The amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                                 (B) That amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase in the funds appropriated under section 619
                                      of the Act from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or

                                 (A) The amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                                 (B) That amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase in the amount appropriated under section

             (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no State's allocation under § 300.808 may exceed the sum of—

                   (1) The amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year; and

                   (2) That amount multiplied by the sum of 1.5 percent and the percentage increase in the amount appropriated under
                         section 619 of the Act from the preceding fiscal year.

             (c)   If the amount available for allocation to States under § 300.808 and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is insufficient to
                   pay those allocations in full, those allocations are ratably reduced, subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(c)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(C))



       § 300.810 Decrease in funds.
       If the amount available for allocations to States under § 300.807 for a fiscal year is less than the amount allocated to the States
       under section 619 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as follows:


             (a) If the amount available for allocations is greater than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State is
                   allocated the sum of—

                   (1) The amount the State received under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997; and

                   (2) An amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as the increase the State received under section 619
                         of the Act for the preceding fiscal year over fiscal year 1997 bears to the total of all such increases for all States.

             (b) If the amount available for allocations is equal to or less than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each
                   State is allocated the amount the State received for fiscal year 1997, ratably reduced, if necessary.

             (a) For the purpose of administering section 619 of the Act (including the coordination of activities under Part B of the Act with,
                   and providing technical assistance to, other programs that provide services to children with disabilities), a State may use

       (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(e))



       § 300.814 Other State-level activities.
       Each State must use any funds the State reserves under § 300.812 and does not use for administration under § 300.813—


             (a) For support services (including establishing and implementing the mediation process required by section 615(e) of the Act),

                   who are eligible for services under section 619 of the Act and who previously received services under Part C of the Act until
                   such children enter, or are eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten; or

             (f)   At the State's discretion, to continue service coordination or case management for families who receive services under Part
                   C of the Act, consistent with § 300.814(e).

       not reserve under § 300.812 to LEAs (including public charter schools that operate as LEAs) in the State that have established their
       eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Effective with funds that become available on July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to
       eligible LEAs that are responsible for providing education to children aged three through five years, including public charter schools
       that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any preschool children with disabilities.

             (a) Base payments. The State must first award each LEA described in § 300.815 the amount that agency would have received
                   under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had distributed 75 percent of its grant for that year under

                         the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the new LEA,
                         among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages three through
                         five currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;

                   (2) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the State must combine the base allocations of the merged
                         LEAs;

                         special education by each affected LEA; and

                   (4) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for the
                         first fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it is serving any children with disabilities
                         aged three through five years. The State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this
                         section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities aged three through five
                         years now being served by the LEA, among the LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with
                         disabilities aged three through five years currently provided special education by each of the LEAs. This requirement
                         takes effect with funds that become available on July 1, 2009.
             (c)   Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under paragraph (a) of this section, the State must—

                   (1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in
                         public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; and

                   (2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in accordance with their relative numbers of children living
                         in poverty, as determined by the SEA.

             (d) Use of best data. For the purpose of making grants under this section, States must apply on a uniform basis across all LEAs
                   the best data that are available to them on the numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary and secondary
                   schools and the numbers of children living in poverty.

       § 300.817 Reallocation of LEA funds.
             (a) If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities aged three through five years
                   residing in the area served by the LEA with State and local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under
                   section 619 of the Act that are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State that are not adequately
                   providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities aged three through five years residing in the
                   areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has
                   not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.812.

             (b) After an SEA distributes section 619 funds to an eligible LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities aged three
                   through five years, as provided in § 300.815, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of time prior to the end of
                   the carryover period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may reallocate any of those funds

       Except as otherwise provided, amounts provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act may be used only to pay the excess costs of

       elementary school or secondary school student with a disability that are in excess of the average annual per student expenditure in an
       LEA during the preceding school year for an elementary school or secondary school student, as may be appropriate. An LEA must

       Section 602(8) of the Act and § 300.16 require the LEA to compute the minimum average amount separately for children with
       disabilities in its elementary schools and for children with disabilities in its secondary schools. LEAs may not compute the minimum
       average amount it must spend on the education of children with disabilities based on a combination of the enrollments in its
       elementary schools and secondary schools.


       The following example shows how to compute the minimum average amount an LEA must spend for the education of each of its
       elementary school children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the Act before it may use funds under Part B of the Act.


             a.    First the LEA must determine the total amount of its expenditures for elementary school students from all sources—local,
                   State, and Federal (including Part B)—in the preceding school year. Only capital outlay and debt services are excluded.


                    Example: The following is an example of a computation for children with disabilities enrolled in an LEA's elementary
                    schools. In this example, the LEA had an average elementary school enrollment for the preceding school year of 800
                    (including 100 children with disabilities). The LEA spent the following amounts last year for elementary school
                    students (including its elementary school children with disabilities):



                                  (1)           From State and local tax funds                                                                           $6,500,000

                                  (2)           From Federal funds                                                                                         600,000

                                                Total expenditures                                                                                        7,100,000



                     Of this total, $60,000 was for capital outlay and debt service relating to the education of elementary school students.
                    This must be subtracted from total expenditures.



                                  (1)    Total Expenditures                                                                                              $7,100,000

                                  (2)    Less capital outlay and debt                                                                                      −60,000

                                         Total expenditures for elementary school students less capital outlay and                                       $7,040,000
                                         debt



             b.    Next, the LEA must subtract from the total expenditures amounts spent for:

                   (1) IDEA, Part B allocation,

                   (2) ESEA, Title I, Part A allocation,

                   (3) ESEA, Title III, Parts A and B allocation,

                   (4) State and local funds for children with disabilities, and

                   (5) State or local funds for programs under ESEA, Title I, Part A, and Title III, Parts A and B.

                         These are funds that the LEA actually spent, not funds received last year but carried over for the current school year.


                          Example: The LEA spent the following amounts for elementary school students last year:



                                        (1)     From funds under IDEA, Part B allocation                                                                  $ 200,000

                                        (2)     From funds under ESEA, Title I, Part A allocation                                                          250,000

                                        (3)     From funds under ESEA, Title III, Parts A and B allocation                                                  50,000

                   year (including its children with disabilities) into the amount computed under the above paragraph. The amount obtained
                   through this computation is the minimum amount the LEA must spend (on the average) for the education of each of its
                   elementary school children with disabilities. Funds under Part B of the Act may be used only for costs over and above this
                   minimum.

                   elementary school children with disabilities in the LEA (not including capital outlay and debt service), the LEA must multiply
                   the number of elementary school children with disabilities in the LEA times the average annual per student expenditure
                   obtained in paragraph c above. Funds under Part B of the Act can only be used for excess costs over and above this

       Appendix B to Part 300—Proportionate Share Calculation
       Each LEA must expend, during the grant period, on the provision of special education and related services for the parentally-placed
       private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA an amount
       that is equal to—


             (1) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21.
                   This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act as the number of
                   parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 enrolled in private elementary schools and
                   secondary schools located in the LEA is to the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and private
                   elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA aged 3 through 21; and

5/20/25, 6:09 PM                                       eCFR :: 34 CFR Part 300 -- Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities
             (2) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5.
                   This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the total
                   number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 enrolled in private elementary schools
                   located in the LEA is to the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools
                   located in the LEA aged 3 through 5.

       Consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act and § 300.133 of these regulations, annual expenditures for parentally-placed
       private school children with disabilities are calculated based on the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and
       private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA eligible to receive special education and related services under
       Part B, as compared with the total number of eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private
       elementary schools located in the LEA. This ratio is used to determine the proportion of the LEA's total Part B subgrants under section
       611(f) of the Act for children aged 3 through 21, and under section 619(g) of the Act for children aged 3 through 5, that is to be
       expended on services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and
       secondary schools located in the LEA.


       The following is an example of how the proportionate share is calculated:


       There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in the Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed private
       school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA for a total of 320
       eligible public and private school children with disabilities (note: proportionate share for parentally-placed private school children is
       based on total children eligible, not children served). The number of eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities
       (20) divided by the total number of eligible public and private school children with disabilities (320) indicates that 6.25 percent of the
       LEA's subgrant must be spent for the group of eligible parentally-placed children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary
       schools and secondary schools located in the LEA. Flintstone School District receives $152,500 in Federal flow through funds.
       Therefore, the LEA must spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the group of parentally-placed private school
       children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA. (Note: The LEA must
       calculate the proportionate share of IDEA funds before earmarking funds for any early intervening activities in § 300.226).


       The following outlines the calculations for the example of how the proportionate share is calculated.



                     Proportionate Share Calculation for Parentally-Placed Private School Children with
                     Disabilities For Flintstone School District:

       Under sections 612(a)(23)(A) and 674(e)(4) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as amended by the Individuals with
       Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the Secretary of Education establishes the NIMAS. Under section 674(e)(4) of the
       Act, the NIMAS applies to print instructional materials published after July 19, 2006. The purpose of the NIMAS is to help increase the
       availability and timely delivery of print instructional materials in accessible formats to blind or other persons with print disabilities in
       elementary and secondary schools.


       Technical Specifications—The Baseline Element Set


       The Baseline Element Set details the minimum requirement that must be delivered to fulfill the NIMAS. It is the responsibility of
       publishers to provide this NIMAS-conformant XML content file, a package file (OPF), a PDF-format copy of the title page (or whichever
       page(s) contain(s) ISBN and copyright information), and a full set of the content's images. All of the images included within a work
       must be provided in a folder and placeholders entered in the relevant XML document indicating their location (all images must be
       included). The preferred image type is SVG, next is either PNG or JPG format. Images should be rendered in the same size/proportion
       as their originals at 300 dpi. Images should be named with relative path filenames in XML files (example: img id=“staricon4”
       src=“./images/U10C02/staricon4.jpg” alt=“star icon”).


       NIMAS-conformant content must be valid to the NIMAS 1.1 [see ANSI/NISO Z39.86 2005 or subsequent revisions]. In addition, files
       are required to use the tags from the Baseline Element Set when such tags are appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to augment
       the required Baseline Element Set with tags from the Optional Element Set (elements not included in the Standard) as applicable. For
       the purposes of NIMAS, appropriate usage of elements, both baseline and optional, is defined by the DAISY Structure Guidelines. Files
       that do not follow these guidelines in the selection and application of tags are not conformant to this Standard. Both optional

                     frontmatter         Usually contains <doctitle>and <docauthor>, as well as preliminary material that is
                                         often enclosed in appropriate <level>or <level1>etc. Content may include a
                                         copyright notice, a foreword, an acknowledgements section, a table of contents,
                                         etc. <frontmatter>serves as a guide to the content and nature of a <book>.

                     bodymatter          Consists of the text proper of a book, as contrasted with preliminary material
                                         <frontmatter>or supplementary information in <rearmatter>.

                       Element                                                            Description

                     rearmatter          Contains supplementary material such as appendices, glossaries, bibliographies,
                                         and indices. It follows the <bodymatter>of the book.

                     level1              The highest-level container of major divisions of a book. Used in <frontmatter>,
                                         <bodymatter>, and <rearmatter>to mark the largest divisions of the book (usually
                                         parts or chapters), inside which <level2>subdivisions (often sections) may nest.
                                         The class attribute identifies the actual name (e.g., part, chapter) of the structure
                                         it marks. Contrast with <level>.

                     level2              Contains subdivisions that nest within <level1>divisions. The class attribute
                                         identifies the actual name (e.g., subpart, chapter, subsection) of the structure it
                                         marks.

                     level3              Contains sub-subdivisions that nest within <level2>subdivisions (e.g., sub-
                                         subsections within subsections). The class attribute identifies the actual name
                                         (e.g., section, subpart, subsubsection) of the subordinate structure it marks.

                     level4              Contains further subdivisions that nest within <level3>subdivisions. The class
                                         attribute identifies the actual name of the subordinate structure it marks.

                     level5              Contains further subdivisions that nest within <level4>subdivisions. The class
                                         attribute identifies the actual name of the subordinate structure it marks.

                     level6              Contains further subdivisions that nest within <level5>subdivisions. The class
                                         attribute identifies the actual name of the subordinate structure it marks.

                     h1                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level1>structure.

                     h2                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level2>structure.

                     h3                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level3>structure.

                     h4                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level4>structure.

                     h5                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level5>structure.

                     h6                  Contains the text of the heading for a <level6>structure.

                                                                             c. Block elements


                     author              Identifies the writer of a work other than this one. Contrast with <docauthor>,
                                         which identifies the author of this work. <author>typically occurs within
                                         <blockquote>and <cite>.

                     blockquote          Indicates a block of quoted content that is set off from the surrounding text by
                                         paragraph breaks. Compare with <q>, which marks short, inline quotations.

                     list                Contains some form of list, ordered or unordered. The list may have an intermixed
                                         heading <hd>(generally only one, possibly with <prodnote>), and an intermixture
                                         of list items <li>and <pagenum>. If bullets and outline enumerations are part of
                                         the print content, they are expected to prefix those list items in content, rather
                                         than be implicitly generated.

                          Element                                                         Description

                     li                  Marks each list item in a <list>. <li>content may be either inline or block and may
                                         include other nested lists. Alternatively it may contain a sequence of list item
                                         components, <lic>, that identify regularly occurring content, such as the heading
                                         and page number of each entry in a table of contents.

                     hd                  Marks the text of a heading in a <list>or <sidebar>.

                     note                Marks a footnote, endnote, etc. Any local reference to <note id=“yyy”>is by
                                         <noteref idref=“#yyy””>. [Attribute id]

                     p                   Contains a paragraph, which may contain subsidiary <list>or <dl>.

                     sidebar             Contains information supplementary to the main text and/or narrative flow and is
                                         often boxed and printed apart from the main text block on a page. It may have a
                                         heading <hd>.

                     cite                Marks a reference (or citation) to another document.

                     dd                  Marks a definition of the preceding term <dt>within a definition list <dl>. A
                                         definition without a preceding <dt>has no semantic interpretation, but is visually
                                         presented aligned with other <dd>.

                     dl                  Contains a definition list, usually consisting of pairs of terms <dt>and definitions
                                         <dd>. Any definition can contain another definition list.

                     dt                  Marks a term in a definition list <dl>for which a definition <dd>follows.

                     em                  Indicates emphasis. Usually <em>is rendered in italics. Compare with <strong>.

                     q                   Contains a short, inline quotation. Compare with <blockquote>, which marks a
                                         longer quotation set off from the surrounding text.

                     strong              Marks stronger emphasis than <em>. Visually <strong>is usually rendered bold.

                     sub                 Indicates a subscript character (printed below a character's normal baseline). Can
                                         be used recursively and/or intermixed with <sup>.

                     sup                 Marks a superscript character (printed above a character's normal baseline). Can
                                         be used recursively and/or intermixed with <sub>.

                     br                  Marks a forced line break.

                     line                Marks a single logical line of text. Often used in conjunction with <linenum>in
                                         documents with numbered lines. [Use only when line breaks must be preserved to
                                         capture meaning (e.g., poems, legal texts).]

                     linenum             Contains a line number, for example in legal text. [Use only when <line>is used,
                                         and only for lines numbered in print book.]

                     pagenum             Contains one page number as it appears from the print document, usually
                                         inserted at the point within the file immediately preceding the first item of content
                                         on a new page. [NB: Only valid when it includes an id attribute].

                     noteref             Marks one or more characters that reference a footnote or endnote <note>.
                                         Contrast with <annoref>. <noteref>and <note>are independently skippable.

                     table               Contains cells of tabular data arranged in rows and columns. A <table>may have
                                         a <caption>. It may have descriptions of the columns in <col>s or groupings of
                                         several <col>in <colgroup>. A simple <table>may be made up of just rows <tr>. A
                                         long table crossing several pages of the print book should have separate
                                         <pagenum>values for each of the pages containing that <table>indicated on the
                                         page where it starts. Note the logical order of optional <thead>, optional <tfoot>,
                                         then one or more of either <tbody>or just rows <tr>. This order accommodates
                                         simple or large, complex tables. The <thead>and <tfoot>information usually helps
                                         identify content of the <tbody>rows. For a multiple-page print <table>the
                                         <thead>and <tfoot>are repeated on each page, but not redundantly tagged.

                     td                  Indicates a table cell containing data.

                     tr                  Marks one row of a <table>containing <th>or <td>cells.

                                                                                  f. Images


                     imggroup            Provides a container for one or more <img>and associated <caption>(s) and
                                         <prodnote>(s). A <prodnote>may contain a description of the image. The content
                                         model allows: 1) multiple <img>if they share a caption, with the ids of each
                                         <img>in the <caption imgref=“id1 id2 ...”>, 2) multiple <caption>if several captions
                                         refer to a single <img id=“xxx”>where each caption has the same <caption
                                         imgref=“xxx”>, 3) multiple <prodnote>if different versions are needed for different
                                         media (e.g., large print, braille, or print). If several <prodnote>refer to a single <img
                                         id=“xxx”>, each prodnote has the same <prodnote imgref=“xxx”>.

                     img                 Points to the image to be rendered. An <img>may stand alone or be grouped
                                         using <imggroup>. Note that providing extracted images is not a requirement of
                                         the NIMAS. If they are included, it is best to refer to them using <img>within the
                                         <imggroup>container.

                     caption             Describes a <table>or <img>. If used with <table>it must follow immediately after
                                         the <table>start tag. If used with <imggroup>it is not so constrained.

       1. The Optional Elements and Guidelines for Use

                   Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline (required) elements. The complete DTBook Element Set
                   reflects the tags necessary to create the six types of Digital Talking Books and Braille output. Because of the present
                   necessity to subdivide the creation of alternate format materials into distinct phases, the Panel determined that baseline

https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300                                                                                    139/226
5/20/25, 6:09 PM                                       eCFR :: 34 CFR Part 300 -- Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities
                   elements would be provided by publishers, and optional elements would be added to the NIMAS-conformant files by third
                   party conversion entities. In both circumstances the protocols for tagging digital files should conform to the most current
                   ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification. Content converters are directed to the most current DAISY Structure Guidelines
                   (http://www.daisy.org/z3986/) for guidance on their use.

                   Since the publication of the original National File Format report from which the NIMAS technical specifications were
                   derived, ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 was updated and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005. It may be best to avoid using the
                   following optional elements which are no longer included in ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005: style, notice, hr, and levelhd.

                   Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 and should be considered optional elements
                   for the NIMAS: bridgehead, byline, covertitle, dateline, epigraph, linegroup, and poem. Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86-
                   2005 for additional information regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 specification, go to

       2. Package File

                   A package file describes a publication. It identifies all other files in the publication and provides descriptive and access
                   information about them. A publication must include a package file conforming to the NIMAS. The package file is based on
                   the Open eBook Publication Structure 1.2 package file specification (For most recent detail please see
                   http://www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2). A NIMAS package file must be an XML-valid
                   OeB PS 1.2 package file instance and must meet the following additional standards:

                   The NIMAS Package File must include the following Dublin Core (dc:)metadata:

       dc:Title.
       dc:Creator (if applicable).
       dc:Publisher.
       dc:Date (Date of NIMAS-compliant file creation—yyyy-mm-dd).
       dc:Format (=“NIMAS 1.0”).
       dc:Identifier (a unique identifier for the NIMAS-compliant digital publication, e.g., print ISBN + “-NIMAS”—exact format to be
             determined).
       dc:Language (one instance, or multiple in the case of a foreign language textbook, etc.).
       dc:Rights (details to be determined).
       dc:Source (ISBN of print version of textbook).


                   And the following x-metadata items:

       nimas-SourceEdition (the edition of the print textbook).
       nimas-SourceDate (date of publication of the print textbook).


                   The following metadata were proposed also as a means of facilitating recordkeeping, storage and file retrieval:

       dc:Subject (Lang Arts, Soc Studies, etc.).
       nimas-grade (specific grade level of the print textbook, e.g.; Grade 6).
       nimas gradeRange (specific grade range of the print textbook, e.g.; Grades 4-5).


                   An additional suggestion references the use of:

       dc:audience:educationLevel (for the grade and gradeRange identifiers, noting that Dublin Core recommends using educationLevel
             with an appropriate controlled vocabulary for context, and recommends the U.S. Department of Education's Level of Education
             vocabulary online at http://www.ed.gov/admin/reference/index.jsp. Using educationLevel obviates the need for a separate field
             for gradeRange since dc elements can repeat more than once. A book used in more than one grade would therefore have two
             elements, one with value “Grade 4” and another with value “Grade 5.”


                   A final determination as to which of these specific metadata elements to use needs to be clarified in practice. The package
                   manifest must list all provided files (text, images, etc.).

             (Note: For purposes of continuity and to minimize errors in transformation and processing, the NIMAS-compliant digital text
             should be provided as a single document.)


       3. Modular Extensions
       The most current DAISY/NISO standard, formally the ANSI/NISO Z39.86, Specifications for the Digital Talking Book defines a
       comprehensive system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of this standard is DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a core
       set of elements needed to produce most types of books. However, DTBook is not intended to be an exhaustive vocabulary for all

       types of books.


       Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing,
       workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of the extensions that have been discussed. Visit

       Appendix D to Part 300—Maintenance of Effort and Early Intervening Services
       LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in accordance with § 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds for
       early intervening services under § 300.226 must do so with caution because the local maintenance of effort reduction provision and
       the authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services are interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes about the
       amount of funds that it uses for one purpose affect the amount that it may use for the other. Below are examples that illustrate how
       §§ 300.205(d) and 300.226(a) affect one another.


         Example 1: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the LEA's total grant (see § 300.226(a)), which is the maximum
         amount that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is greater than the amount that may be used for local
         maintenance of effort (MOE) reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's grant from the prior year's grant) (see §
         300.205(a)).



                       Prior Year's Allocation                                                                                                 $900,000.

                       Current Year's Allocation                                                                                               1,000,000.

                       Increase                                                                                                                  100,000.

                       Maximum Available for MOE Reduction                                                                                         50,000.

                       Maximum Available for EIS                                                                                                 150,000.



          If the LEA chooses to set aside $150,000 for EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $150,000 for EIS
         means $0 can be used for MOE).
         If the LEA chooses to set aside $100,000 for EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $100,000 for EIS
         means $0 can be used for MOE).


         If the LEA chooses to set aside $50,000 for EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $50,000 for EIS
         means $0 can be used for MOE).


         If the LEA chooses to set aside $30,000 for EIS, it may reduce its MOE by $20,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $30,000 for
         EIS means $20,000 can be used for MOE).


         If the LEA chooses to set aside $0 for EIS, it may reduce its MOE by $50,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $0 for EIS means
         $50,000 can be used for MOE).


         Example 2: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the LEA's total grant (see § 300.226(a)), which is the maximum
         amount that the LEA may use for EIS, is less than the amount that may be used for MOE reduction (50 percent of the increase
         in the LEA's grant from the prior year's grant) (see § 300.205(a)).



                       Prior Year's Allocation                                                                                               $1,000,000.

                       Current Year's Allocation                                                                                               2,000,000.

                       Increase                                                                                                                1,000,000.

          If the LEA chooses to use no funds for MOE, it may set aside $300,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $0 means

       Appendix E to Part 300—Local Educational Agency Maintenance of Effort Calculation Examples
       The following tables provide examples of calculating LEA MOE. Figures are in $10,000s. All references to a “fiscal year” in these
       tables refer to the fiscal year covering that school year, unless otherwise noted.


       Tables 1 through 4 provide examples of how an LEA complies with the Subsequent Years rule. In Table 1, for example, an LEA spent
       $1 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-2013 on the education of children with disabilities. In the following year, the LEA was required to
       spend at least $1 million but spent only $900,000. In FY 2014-2015, therefore, the LEA was required to spend $1 million, the amount it
       was required to spend in FY 2013-2014, not the $900,000 it actually spent.

       Table 5 provides an example of how an LEA may meet the compliance standard using alternate methods from year to year without
       using the exceptions or adjustment in §§ 300.204 and 300.205, and provides information on the following scenario. In FY 2015-2016,
       the LEA meets the compliance standard using all four methods. As a result, in order to demonstrate that it met the compliance
       standard using any one of the four methods in FY 2016-2017, the LEA must expend at least as much as it did in FY 2015-2016 using
       that same method. Because the LEA spent the same amount in FY 2016-2017 as it did in FY 2015-2016, calculated using a
       combination of State and local funds and a combination of State and local funds on a per capita basis, the LEA met the compliance
       standard using both of those methods in FY 2016-2017. However, the LEA did not meet the compliance standard in FY 2016-2017
       using the other two methods—local funds only or local funds only on a per capita basis—because it did not spend at least the same
       amount in FY 2016-2017 as it did in FY 2015-2016 using the same methods.

                     Note: When calculating any exception(s) and/or adjustment on a per capita basis for the purpose
                     of determining the required level of effort, the LEA must use the child count from the comparison
                     year, and not the child count of the year in which the LEA took the exception(s) and/or adjustment.
                     When determining the actual level of effort on a per capita basis, the LEA must use the child count
                     for the current year. For example, in 2018-2019, the LEA uses a child count of 9, not the child count
                     of 10 in the comparison year, to determine the actual level of effort.

                     Note: When calculating any exception(s) and/or adjustment on a per capita basis for the purpose
                     of determining the required level of effort, the LEA must use the child count from the comparison
                     year, and not the child count of the year in which the LEA took the exception(s) and/or adjustment.
                     When determining the actual level of effort on a per capita basis, the LEA must use the child count
                     for the current year. For example, in 2018-2019, the LEA uses a child count of 9, not the child count
                     of 10 in the comparison year, to determine the actual level of effort.

                     Note: When calculating any exception(s) and/or adjustment on a per capita basis for the purpose
                     of determining the required level of effort, the LEA must use the child count from the comparison
                     year, and not the child count of the year in which the LEA took the exception(s) and/or adjustment.
                     When determining the actual level of effort on a per capita basis, the LEA must use the child count
                     for the current year. For example, in 2018-2019, the LEA uses a child count of 9, not the child count
                     of 10 in the comparison year, to determine the actual level of effort.

       to year. These tables assume that the LEA did not take any of the exceptions or adjustment in §§ 300.204 and 300.205. Numbers are
       in $10,000s budgeted and spent for the education of children with disabilities.

       Table 10 provides examples both of how to calculate the amount by which an LEA failed to maintain its level of expenditures and of
       the amount of non-Federal funds that an SEA must return to the Department on account of that failure.

                     The SEA determines that the amount of the LEA's failure is $100 using the calculation method that
                     results in the lowest amount of a failure. The SEA's liability is the lesser of the four calculated
                     shortfalls and the amount of the LEA's Part B subgrant in the fiscal year in which the LEA failed to
                     meet the compliance standard. In this case, the SEA must return $50 to the Department because
                     the LEA's IDEA Part B subgrant was $50, and that is the lower amount.

                     * LEA met MOE using this method.
