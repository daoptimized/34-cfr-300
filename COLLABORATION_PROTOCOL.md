# AI Collaboration Protocol for KDP Project: 34 CFR 300 Navigable Ebook

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the collaboration protocol between the User (Author) and CADR-GPT (AI) for the project of converting "34 CFR 300" into a highly navigable Kindle ebook. The goal is to ensure a clear, efficient, and productive working relationship.

## 2. Interaction Methods

A dual approach will be utilized for interactions:

*   **Structured Prompts (JSON Recommended):**
    *   **Purpose:** For complex, multi-step tasks requiring precision and clear parameterization.
    *   **Examples:** Generating detailed, navigable structures for large subparts of "34 CFR 300"; transforming specific sections with intricate formatting, internal linking, and cross-referencing requirements; batch processing of similar regulatory sections.
    *   **Reference:** `2.4. APPENDIX_E.md` (Example AI Interaction Protocol) will be consulted for schema examples and best practices. CADR-GPT may assist in formulating JSON requests if needed.
*   **Conversational Prompts:**
    *   **Purpose:** For brainstorming navigation strategies, asking quick questions about specific regulations, requesting simple revisions to AI-generated content, exploring formatting options for readability, or iteratively refining smaller text segments.
    *   **Flexibility:** This mode allows for more fluid, exploratory dialogue.

## 3. Context Provision
Effective AI assistance relies heavily on clear and sufficient context. The User will strive to provide:
*   Specific citations (e.g., section numbers, subparts) of "34 CFR 300" relevant to the current task.
*   References to the `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` document for high-level decisions, target audience needs (once defined), and overall ebook structure.
*   Examples of effective or ineffective navigation from other Kindle ebooks or digital documents, if applicable, to illustrate preferences.
*   Clear articulation of the desired outcome for any given request.

## 4. Verification & Feedback Loop

Rigorous verification of AI-generated content is crucial. The following steps will be taken:

*   **Accuracy of Transformation:** The User will verify that the core meaning, legal accuracy, and nuances of "34 CFR 300" are perfectly preserved in any restructured, summarized, or reformatted content generated by the AI.
*   **Navigational Integrity:** The User will test all internal links, tables of contents, indexes, glossaries, and any novel navigational elements proposed or implemented by the AI to ensure they function correctly, lead to the intended destinations, and enhance usability.
*   **Formatting & Stylistic Consistency:** The User will check for adherence to agreed-upon Kindle formatting best practices and project-specific stylistic choices for headings, lists, tables, call-out boxes, and other textual elements. This will align with the (yet to be created) `STYLE_TONE_VOICE_GUIDE.md` and KDP guidelines.
*   **Prompt Adherence & User Vision Alignment:** The User will confirm that the AI's output directly addresses the specific prompt and aligns with the overarching vision for a highly navigable, user-friendly ebook version of "34 CFR 300."
*   **"Reader Usability" Check (Preliminary & Ongoing):** Generated content and navigational structures will be mentally evaluated against the needs and expectations of the target reader personas (to be developed in `3.1. MODULE_1.md`).

**Mandatory Feedback Loop:**
User review and explicit approval (or a request for specific revisions) are **mandatory** after each significant AI generation cycle or task completion. CADR-GPT will await this confirmation before proceeding to subsequent tasks. This iterative process ensures alignment and quality throughout the project.

## 5. AI Role
CADR-GPT's role is that of a collaborative partner and accelerator. It will assist in:
*   Analyzing the structure of "34 CFR 300."
*   Brainstorming and proposing innovative navigation strategies.
*   Drafting and formatting content according to the defined structure and KDP best practices.
*   Identifying potential inconsistencies or areas for improved clarity.
*   Assisting in the creation and maintenance of project documentation.

The User remains the final authority on all content, structural decisions, and creative choices.
